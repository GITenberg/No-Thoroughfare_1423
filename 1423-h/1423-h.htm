<h1>NO THOROUGHFARE</h1>
<h2>THE OVERTURE.</h2>
<p>Day of the month and year, November the thirtieth, one thousand eight
hundred and thirty-five.&nbsp; London Time by the great clock of Saint
Paul&rsquo;s, ten at night.&nbsp; All the lesser London churches strain
their metallic throats.&nbsp; Some, flippantly begin before the heavy
bell of the great cathedral; some, tardily begin three, four, half a
dozen, strokes behind it; all are in sufficiently near accord, to leave
a resonance in the air, as if the winged father who devours his children,
had made a sounding sweep with his gigantic scythe in flying over the
city.</p>
<p>What is this clock lower than most of the rest, and nearer to the
ear, that lags so far behind to-night as to strike into the vibration
alone?&nbsp; This is the clock of the Hospital for Foundling Children.&nbsp;
Time was, when the Foundlings were received without question in a cradle
at the gate.&nbsp; Time is, when inquiries are made respecting them,
and they are taken as by favour from the mothers who relinquish all
natural knowledge of them and claim to them for evermore.</p>
<p>The moon is at the full, and the night is fair with light clouds.&nbsp;
The day has been otherwise than fair, for slush and mud, thickened with
the droppings of heavy fog, lie black in the streets.&nbsp; The veiled
lady who flutters up and down near the postern-gate of the Hospital
for Foundling Children has need to be well shod to-night.</p>
<p>She flutters to and fro, avoiding the stand of hackney-coaches, and
often pausing in the shadow of the western end of the great quadrangle
wall, with her face turned towards the gate.&nbsp; As above her there
is the purity of the moonlit sky, and below her there are the defilements
of the pavement, so may she, haply, be divided in her mind between two
vistas of reflection or experience.&nbsp; As her footprints crossing
and recrossing one another have made a labyrinth in the mire, so may
her track in life have involved itself in an intricate and unravellable
tangle.</p>
<p>The postern-gate of the Hospital for Foundling Children opens, and
a young woman comes out.&nbsp; The lady stands aside, observes closely,
sees that the gate is quietly closed again from within, and follows
the young woman.</p>
<p>Two or three streets have been traversed in silence before she, following
close behind the object of her attention, stretches out her hand and
touches her.&nbsp; Then the young woman stops and looks round, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You touched me last night, and, when I turned my head, you
would not speak.&nbsp; Why do you follow me like a silent ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; returned the lady, in a low voice, &ldquo;that
I would not speak, but that I could not when I tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of me?&nbsp; I have never done you any harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what can you want of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two guineas in this paper.&nbsp; Take my poor little
present, and I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the young woman&rsquo;s face, which is honest and comely, comes
a flush as she replies: &ldquo;There is neither grown person nor child
in all the large establishment that I belong to, who hasn&rsquo;t a
good word for Sally.&nbsp; I am Sally.&nbsp; Could I be so well thought
of, if I was to be bought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to buy you; I mean only to reward you very slightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally firmly, but not ungently, closes and puts back the offering
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there is anything I can do for you, ma&rsquo;am,
that I will not do for its own sake, you are much mistaken in me if
you think that I will do it for money.&nbsp; What is it you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are one of the nurses or attendants at the Hospital; I
saw you leave to-night and last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&nbsp; I am Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a pleasant patience in your face which makes me believe
that very young children would take readily to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless &lsquo;em!&nbsp; So they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady lifts her veil, and shows a face no older than the nurse&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
A face far more refined and capable than hers, but wild and worn with
sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the miserable mother of a baby lately received under
your care.&nbsp; I have a prayer to make to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively respecting the confidence which has drawn aside the
veil, Sally&mdash;whose ways are all ways of simplicity and spontaneity&mdash;replaces
it, and begins to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will listen to my prayer?&rdquo; the lady urges.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will not be deaf to the agonised entreaty of such a broken
suppliant as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, dear, dear!&rdquo; cries Sally.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
shall I say, or can say!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk of prayers.&nbsp; Prayers
are to be put up to the Good Father of All, and not to nurses and such.&nbsp;
And there!&nbsp; I am only to hold my place for half a year longer,
till another young woman can be trained up to it.&nbsp; I am going to
be married.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t have been out last night, and I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been out to-night, but that my Dick (he is the
young man I am going to be married to) lies ill, and I help his mother
and sister to watch him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t take on so, don&rsquo;t take
on so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O good Sally, dear Sally,&rdquo; moans the lady, catching
at her dress entreatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you are hopeful, and I am
hopeless; as a fair way in life is before you, which can never, never,
be before me; as you can aspire to become a respected wife, and as you
can aspire to become a proud mother, as you are a living loving woman,
and must die; for GOD&rsquo;S sake hear my distracted petition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deary, deary, deary ME!&rdquo; cries Sally, her desperation
culminating in the pronoun, &ldquo;what am I ever to do?&nbsp; And there!&nbsp;
See how you turn my own words back upon me.&nbsp; I tell you I am going
to be married, on purpose to make it clearer to you that I am going
to leave, and therefore couldn&rsquo;t help you if I would, Poor Thing,
and you make it seem to my own self as if I was cruel in going to be
married and not helping you.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t kind.&nbsp; Now, is
it kind, Poor Thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally!&nbsp; Hear me, my dear.&nbsp; My entreaty is for no
help in the future.&nbsp; It applies to what is past.&nbsp; It is only
to be told in two words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&nbsp; This is worse and worse,&rdquo; cries Sally,
&ldquo;supposing that I understand what two words you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do understand.&nbsp; What are the names they have given
my poor baby?&nbsp; I ask no more than that.&nbsp; I have read of the
customs of the place.&nbsp; He has been christened in the chapel, and
registered by some surname in the book.&nbsp; He was received last Monday
evening.&nbsp; What have they called him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down upon her knees in the foul mud of the by-way into which they
have strayed&mdash;an empty street without a thoroughfare giving on
the dark gardens of the Hospital&mdash;the lady would drop in her passionate
entreaty, but that Sally prevents her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You make me feel as
if I was setting myself up to be good.&nbsp; Let me look in your pretty
face again.&nbsp; Put your two hands in mine.&nbsp; Now, promise.&nbsp;
You will never ask me anything more than the two words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never put them to a bad use, if I say them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter Wilding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady lays her face upon the nurse&rsquo;s breast, draws her close
in her embrace with both arms, murmurs a blessing and the words, &ldquo;Kiss
him for me!&rdquo; and is gone.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Day of the month and year, the first Sunday in October, one thousand
eight hundred and forty-seven.&nbsp; London Time by the great clock
of Saint Paul&rsquo;s, half-past one in the afternoon.&nbsp; The clock
of the Hospital for Foundling Children is well up with the Cathedral
to-day.&nbsp; Service in the chapel is over, and the Foundling children
are at dinner.</p>
<p>There are numerous lookers-on at the dinner, as the custom is.&nbsp;
There are two or three governors, whole families from the congregation,
smaller groups of both sexes, individual stragglers of various degrees.&nbsp;
The bright autumnal sun strikes freshly into the wards; and the heavy-framed
windows through which it shines, and the panelled walls on which it
strikes, are such windows and such walls as pervade Hogarth&rsquo;s
pictures.&nbsp; The girls&rsquo; refectory (including that of the younger
children) is the principal attraction.&nbsp; Neat attendants silently
glide about the orderly and silent tables; the lookers-on move or stop
as the fancy takes them; comments in whispers on face such a number
from such a window are not unfrequent; many of the faces are of a character
to fix attention.&nbsp; Some of the visitors from the outside public
are accustomed visitors.&nbsp; They have established a speaking acquaintance
with the occupants of particular seats at the tables, and halt at those
points to bend down and say a word or two.&nbsp; It is no disparagement
to their kindness that those points are generally points where personal
attractions are.&nbsp; The monotony of the long spacious rooms and the
double lines of faces is agreeably relieved by these incidents, although
so slight.</p>
<p>A veiled lady, who has no companion, goes among the company.&nbsp;
It would seem that curiosity and opportunity have never brought her
there before.&nbsp; She has the air of being a little troubled by the
sight, and, as she goes the length of the tables, it is with a hesitating
step and an uneasy manner.&nbsp; At length she comes to the refectory
of the boys.&nbsp; They are so much less popular than the girls that
it is bare of visitors when she looks in at the doorway.</p>
<p>But just within the doorway, chances to stand, inspecting, an elderly
female attendant: some order of matron or housekeeper.&nbsp; To whom
the lady addresses natural questions: As, how many boys?&nbsp; At what
age are they usually put out in life?&nbsp; Do they often take a fancy
to the sea?&nbsp; So, lower and lower in tone until the lady puts the
question: &ldquo;Which is Walter Wilding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attendant&rsquo;s head shaken.&nbsp; Against the rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know which is Walter Wilding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So keenly does the attendant feel the closeness with which the lady&rsquo;s
eyes examine her face, that she keeps her own eyes fast upon the floor,
lest by wandering in the right direction they should betray her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know which is Walter Wilding, but it is not my place, ma&rsquo;am,
to tell names to visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can show me without telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady&rsquo;s hand moves quietly to the attendant&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
Pause and silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to pass round the tables,&rdquo; says the lady&rsquo;s
interlocutor, without seeming to address her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me
with your eyes.&nbsp; The boy that I stop at and speak to, will not
matter to you.&nbsp; But the boy that I touch, will be Walter Wilding.&nbsp;
Say nothing more to me, and move a little away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly acting on the hint, the lady passes on into the room, and
looks about her.&nbsp; After a few moments, the attendant, in a staid
official way, walks down outside the line of tables commencing on her
left hand.&nbsp; She goes the whole length of the line, turns, and comes
back on the inside.&nbsp; Very slightly glancing in the lady&rsquo;s
direction, she stops, bends forward, and speaks.&nbsp; The boy whom
she addresses, lifts his head and replies.&nbsp; Good humouredly and
easily, as she listens to what he says, she lays her hand upon the shoulder
of the next boy on his right.&nbsp; That the action may be well noted,
she keeps her hand on the shoulder while speaking in return, and pats
it twice or thrice before moving away.&nbsp; She completes her tour
of the tables, touching no one else, and passes out by a door at the
opposite end of the long room.</p>
<p>Dinner is done, and the lady, too, walks down outside the line of
tables commencing on her left hand, goes the whole length of the line,
turns, and comes back on the inside.&nbsp; Other people have strolled
in, fortunately for her, and stand sprinkled about.&nbsp; She lifts
her veil, and, stopping at the touched boy, asks how old he is?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am twelve, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he answers, with his bright
eyes fixed on hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you well and happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you take these sweetmeats from my hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please to give them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In stooping low for the purpose, the lady touches the boy&rsquo;s
face with her forehead and with her hair.&nbsp; Then, lowering her veil
again, she passes on, and passes out without looking back.</p>
<h2>ACT I.</h2>
<h3>THE CURTAIN RISES</h3>
<p>In a court-yard in the City of London, which was No Thoroughfare
either for vehicles or foot-passengers; a court-yard diverging from
a steep, a slippery, and a winding street connecting Tower Street with
the Middlesex shore of the Thames; stood the place of business of Wilding
&amp; Co., Wine Merchants.&nbsp; Probably as a jocose acknowledgment
of the obstructive character of this main approach, the point nearest
to its base at which one could take the river (if so inodorously minded)
bore the appellation Break-Neck-Stairs.&nbsp; The court-yard itself
had likewise been descriptively entitled in old time, Cripple Corner.</p>
<p>Years before the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, people
had left off taking boat at Break-Neck-Stairs, and watermen had ceased
to ply there.&nbsp; The slimy little causeway had dropped into the river
by a slow process of suicide, and two or three stumps of piles and a
rusty iron mooring-ring were all that remained of the departed Break-Neck
glories.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, a laden coal barge would bump itself
into the place, and certain laborious heavers, seemingly mud-engendered,
would arise, deliver the cargo in the neighbourhood, shove off, and
vanish; but at most times the only commerce of Break-Neck-Stairs arose
out of the conveyance of casks and bottles, both full and empty, both
to and from the cellars of Wilding &amp; Co., Wine Merchants.&nbsp;
Even that commerce was but occasional, and through three-fourths of
its rising tides the dirty indecorous drab of a river would come solitarily
oozing and lapping at the rusty ring, as if it had heard of the Doge
and the Adriatic, and wanted to be married to the great conserver of
its filthiness, the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor.</p>
<p>Some two hundred and fifty yards on the right, up the opposite hill
(approaching it from the low ground of Break-Neck-Stairs) was Cripple
Corner.&nbsp; There was a pump in Cripple Corner, there was a tree in
Cripple Corner.&nbsp; All Cripple Corner belonged to Wilding and Co.,
Wine Merchants.&nbsp; Their cellars burrowed under it, their mansion
towered over it.&nbsp; It really had been a mansion in the days when
merchants inhabited the City, and had a ceremonious shelter to the doorway
without visible support, like the sounding-board over an old pulpit.&nbsp;
It had also a number of long narrow strips of window, so disposed in
its grave brick front as to render it symmetrically ugly.&nbsp; It had
also, on its roof, a cupola with a bell in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man at five-and-twenty can put his hat on, and can
say &lsquo;this hat covers the owner of this property and of the business
which is transacted on this property,&rsquo; I consider, Mr. Bintrey,
that, without being boastful, he may be allowed to be deeply thankful.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know how it may appear to you, but so it appears to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Walter Wilding to his man of law, in his own counting-house;
taking his hat down from its peg to suit the action to the word, and
hanging it up again when he had done so, not to overstep the modesty
of nature.</p>
<p>An innocent, open-speaking, unused-looking man, Mr. Walter Wilding,
with a remarkably pink and white complexion, and a figure much too bulky
for so young a man, though of a good stature.&nbsp; With crispy curling
brown hair, and amiable bright blue eyes.&nbsp; An extremely communicative
man: a man with whom loquacity was the irrestrainable outpouring of
contentment and gratitude.&nbsp; Mr. Bintrey, on the other hand, a cautious
man, with twinkling beads of eyes in a large overhanging bald head,
who inwardly but intensely enjoyed the comicality of openness of speech,
or hand, or heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Ha,
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A decanter, two wine-glasses, and a plate of biscuits, stood on the
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like this forty-five year old port-wine?&rdquo; said Mr.
Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the best corner of our best forty-five year
old bin,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
most excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed again, as he held up his glass and ogled it, at the highly
ludicrous idea of giving away such wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Wilding, with a childish enjoyment in
the discussion of affairs, &ldquo;I think we have got everything straight,
Mr. Bintrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything straight,&rdquo; said Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A partner secured&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partner secured,&rdquo; said Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A housekeeper advertised for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Housekeeper advertised for,&rdquo; said Bintrey, &ldquo;&lsquo;apply
personally at Cripple Corner, Great Tower Street, from ten to twelve&rsquo;&mdash;to-morrow,
by the bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My late dear mother&rsquo;s affairs wound up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wound up,&rdquo; said Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all charges paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all charges paid,&rdquo; said Bintrey, with a chuckle:
probably occasioned by the droll circumstance that they had been paid
without a haggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mention of my late dear mother,&rdquo; Mr. Wilding continued,
his eyes filling with tears and his pocket-handkerchief drying them,
&ldquo;unmans me still, Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp; You know how I loved her;
you (her lawyer) know how she loved me.&nbsp; The utmost love of mother
and child was cherished between us, and we never experienced one moment&rsquo;s
division or unhappiness from the time when she took me under her care.&nbsp;
Thirteen years in all!&nbsp; Thirteen years under my late dear mother&rsquo;s
care, Mr. Bintrey, and eight of them her confidentially acknowledged
son!&nbsp; You know the story, Mr. Bintrey, who but you, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Wilding sobbed and dried his eyes, without attempt at concealment,
during these remarks.</p>
<p>Mr. Bintrey enjoyed his comical port, and said, after rolling it
in his mouth: &ldquo;I know the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My late dear mother, Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; pursued the wine-merchant,
&ldquo;had been deeply deceived, and had cruelly suffered.&nbsp; But
on that subject my late dear mother&rsquo;s lips were for ever sealed.&nbsp;
By whom deceived, or under what circumstances, Heaven only knows.&nbsp;
My late dear mother never betrayed her betrayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had made up her mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Bintrey, again turning
his wine on his palate, &ldquo;and she could hold her peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
An amused twinkle in his eyes pretty plainly added&mdash;&ldquo;A devilish
deal better than <i>you</i> ever will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Honour,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding, sobbing as
he quoted from the Commandments, &ldquo;&lsquo;thy father and thy mother,
that thy days may be long in the land.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I was in the
Foundling, Mr. Bintrey, I was at such a loss how to do it, that I apprehended
my days would be short in the land.&nbsp; But I afterwards came to honour
my mother deeply, profoundly.&nbsp; And I honour and revere her memory.&nbsp;
For seven happy years, Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; pursued Wilding, still with
the same innocent catching in his breath, and the same unabashed tears,
&ldquo;did my excellent mother article me to my predecessors in this
business, Pebbleson Nephew.&nbsp; Her affectionate forethought likewise
apprenticed me to the Vintners&rsquo; Company, and made me in time a
free Vintner, and&mdash;and&mdash;everything else that the best of mothers
could desire.&nbsp; When I came of age, she bestowed her inherited share
in this business upon me; it was her money that afterwards bought out
Pebbleson Nephew, and painted in Wilding and Co.; it was she who left
me everything she possessed, but the mourning ring you wear.&nbsp; And
yet, Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; with a fresh burst of honest affection, &ldquo;she
is no more.&nbsp; It is little over half a year since she came into
the Corner to read on that door-post with her own eyes, WILDING AND
CO., WINE MERCHANTS.&nbsp; And yet she is no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad.&nbsp; But the common lot, Mr. Wilding,&rdquo; observed
Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;At some time or other we must all be no more.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He placed the forty-five year old port-wine in the universal condition,
with a relishing sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now, Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; pursued Wilding, putting away
his pocket-handkerchief, and smoothing his eyelids with his fingers,
&ldquo;now that I can no longer show my love and honour for the dear
parent to whom my heart was mysteriously turned by Nature when she first
spoke to me, a strange lady, I sitting at our Sunday dinner-table in
the Foundling, I can at least show that I am not ashamed of having been
a Foundling, and that I, who never knew a father of my own, wish to
be a father to all in my employment.&nbsp; Therefore,&rdquo; continued
Wilding, becoming enthusiastic in his loquacity, &ldquo;therefore, I
want a thoroughly good housekeeper to undertake this dwelling-house
of Wilding and Co., Wine Merchants, Cripple Corner, so that I may restore
in it some of the old relations betwixt employer and employed!&nbsp;
So that I may live in it on the spot where my money is made!&nbsp; So
that I may daily sit at the head of the table at which the people in
my employment eat together, and may eat of the same roast and boiled,
and drink of the same beer!&nbsp; So that the people in my employment
may lodge under the same roof with me!&nbsp; So that we may one and
all&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr. Bintrey, but that old singing in my
head has suddenly come on, and I shall feel obliged if you will lead
me to the pump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alarmed by the excessive pinkness of his client, Mr. Bintrey lost
not a moment in leading him forth into the court-yard.&nbsp; It was
easily done; for the counting-house in which they talked together opened
on to it, at one side of the dwelling-house.&nbsp; There the attorney
pumped with a will, obedient to a sign from the client, and the client
laved his head and face with both hands, and took a hearty drink.&nbsp;
After these remedies, he declared himself much better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your good feelings excite you,&rdquo; said
Bintrey, as they returned to the counting-house, and Mr. Wilding dried
himself on a jack-towel behind an inner door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he returned, looking out
of the towel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I have not been confused,
have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Perfectly clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did I leave off, Mr. Bintrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you left off&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t excite myself,
if I was you, by taking it up again just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take care.&nbsp; The
singing in my head came on at where, Mr. Bintrey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At roast, and boiled, and beer,&rdquo; answered the lawyer,&mdash;&ldquo;prompting
lodging under the same roof&mdash;and one and all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; And one and all singing in the head together&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I really <i>would not</i> let my good feelings
excite me, if I was you,&rdquo; hinted the lawyer again, anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Try some more pump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No occasion, no occasion.&nbsp; All right, Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp;
And one and all forming a kind of family!&nbsp; You see, Mr. Bintrey,
I was not used in my childhood to that sort of individual existence
which most individuals have led, more or less, in their childhood.&nbsp;
After that time I became absorbed in my late dear mother.&nbsp; Having
lost her, I find that I am more fit for being one of a body than one
by myself one.&nbsp; To be that, and at the same time to do my duty
to those dependent on me, and attach them to me, has a patriarchal and
pleasant air about it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it may appear to
you, Mr Bintrey, but so it appears to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not I who am all-important in the case, but you,&rdquo;
returned Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consequently, how it may appear to me
is of very small importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding, in a glow, &ldquo;hopeful,
useful, delightful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; hinted the lawyer again, &ldquo;I really
would not ex&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s Handel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s who?&rdquo; asked Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Kent, Purcell, Doctor Arne, Greene,
Mendelssohn.&nbsp; I know the choruses to those anthems by heart.&nbsp;
Foundling Chapel Collection.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t we learn them
together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who learn them together?&rdquo; asked the lawyer, rather shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Employer and employed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; returned Bintrey, mollified; as if he had half
expected the answer to be, Lawyer and client.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
another thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another thing, Mr. Bintrey!&nbsp; The same thing.&nbsp;
A part of the bond among us.&nbsp; We will form a Choir in some quiet
church near the Corner here, and, having sung together of a Sunday with
a relish, we will come home and take an early dinner together with a
relish.&nbsp; The object that I have at heart now is, to get this system
well in action without delay, so that my new partner may find it founded
when he enters on his partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All good be with it!&rdquo; exclaimed Bintrey, rising.&nbsp;
&ldquo;May it prosper!&nbsp; Is Joey Ladle to take a share in Handel,
Mozart, Haydn, Kent, Purcell, Doctor Arne, Greene, and Mendelssohn?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish them all well out of it,&rdquo; returned Bintrey, with
much heartiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands and parted.&nbsp; Then (first knocking with his
knuckles for leave) entered to Mr. Wilding from a door of communication
between his private counting-house and that in which his clerks sat,
the Head Cellarman of the cellars of Wilding and Co., Wine Merchants,
and erst Head Cellarman of the cellars of Pebbleson Nephew.&nbsp; The
Joey Ladle in question.&nbsp; A slow and ponderous man, of the drayman
order of human architecture, dressed in a corrugated suit and bibbed
apron, apparently a composite of door-mat and rhinoceros-hide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respecting this same boarding and lodging, Young Master Wilding,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking for myself, Young Master Wilding&mdash;and I never
did speak and I never do speak for no one else&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
want no boarding nor yet no lodging.&nbsp; But if you wish to board
me and to lodge me, take me.&nbsp; I can peck as well as most men.&nbsp;
Where I peck ain&rsquo;t so high a object with me as What I peck.&nbsp;
Nor even so high a object with me as How Much I peck.&nbsp; Is all to
live in the house, Young Master Wilding?&nbsp; The two other cellarmen,
the three porters, the two &lsquo;prentices, and the odd men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I hope we shall all be an united family, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Joey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&nbsp; Rather say we, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joey Ladle shook his held.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look to me to
make we on it, Young Master Wilding, not at my time of life and under
the circumstances which has formed my disposition.&nbsp; I have said
to Pebbleson Nephew many a time, when they have said to me, &lsquo;Put
a livelier face upon it, Joey&rsquo;&mdash;I have said to them, &lsquo;Gentlemen,
it is all wery well for you that has been accustomed to take your wine
into your systems by the conwivial channel of your throttles, to put
a lively face upon it; but,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I have been accustomed
to take <i>my</i> wine in at the pores of the skin, and, took that way,
it acts different.&nbsp; It acts depressing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s one thing,
gentlemen,&rsquo; I says to Pebbleson Nephew, &lsquo;to charge your
glasses in a dining-room with a Hip Hurrah and a Jolly Companions Every
One, and it&rsquo;s another thing to be charged yourself, through the
pores, in a low dark cellar and a mouldy atmosphere.&nbsp; It makes
all the difference betwixt bubbles and wapours,&rsquo; I tells Pebbleson
Nephew.&nbsp; And so it do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a cellarman my life
through, with my mind fully given to the business.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the consequence?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as muddled a man as lives&mdash;you
won&rsquo;t find a muddleder man than me&mdash;nor yet you won&rsquo;t
find my equal in molloncolly.&nbsp; Sing of Filling the bumper fair,
Every drop you sprinkle, O&rsquo;er the brow of care, Smooths away a
wrinkle?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; P&rsquo;raps so.&nbsp; But try filling yourself
through the pores, underground, when you don&rsquo;t want to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear this, Joey.&nbsp; I had even thought that
you might join a singing-class in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, sir?&nbsp; No, no, Young Master Wilding, you won&rsquo;t
catch Joey Ladle muddling the Armony.&nbsp; A pecking-machine, sir,
is all that I am capable of proving myself, out of my cellars; but that
you&rsquo;re welcome to, if you think it is worth your while to keep
such a thing on your premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more, sir.&nbsp; The Business&rsquo;s word is my law.&nbsp;
And you&rsquo;re a going to take Young Master George Vendale partner
into the old Business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More changes, you see!&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t change the name
of the Firm again.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do it, Young Master Wilding.&nbsp;
It was bad luck enough to make it Yourself and Co.&nbsp; Better by far
have left it Pebbleson Nephew that good luck always stuck to.&nbsp;
You should never change luck when it&rsquo;s good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events, I have no intention of changing the name of
the House again, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, and wish you good-day, Young Master Wilding.&nbsp;
But you had better by half,&rdquo; muttered Joey Ladle inaudibly, as
he closed the door and shook his head, &ldquo;have let the name alone
from the first.&nbsp; You had better by half have followed the luck
instead of crossing it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>ENTER THE HOUSEKEEPER</h3>
<p>The wine merchant sat in his dining-room next morning, to receive
the personal applicants for the vacant post in his establishment.&nbsp;
It was an old-fashioned wainscoted room; the panels ornamented with
festoons of flowers carved in wood; with an oaken floor, a well-worn
Turkey carpet, and dark mahogany furniture, all of which had seen service
and polish under Pebbleson Nephew.&nbsp; The great sideboard had assisted
at many business-dinners given by Pebbleson Nephew to their connection,
on the principle of throwing sprats overboard to catch whales; and Pebbleson
Nephew&rsquo;s comprehensive three-sided plate-warmer, made to fit the
whole front of the large fireplace, kept watch beneath it over a sarcophagus-shaped
cellaret that had in its time held many a dozen of Pebbleson Nephew&rsquo;s
wine.&nbsp; But the little rubicund old bachelor with a pigtail, whose
portrait was over the sideboard (and who could easily be identified
as decidedly Pebbleson and decidedly not Nephew), had retired into another
sarcophagus, and the plate-warmer had grown as cold as he.&nbsp; So,
the golden and black griffins that supported the candelabra, with black
balls in their mouths at the end of gilded chains, looked as if in their
old age they had lost all heart for playing at ball, and were dolefully
exhibiting their chains in the Missionary line of inquiry, whether they
had not earned emancipation by this time, and were not griffins and
brothers.</p>
<p>Such a Columbus of a morning was the summer morning, that it discovered
Cripple Corner.&nbsp; The light and warmth pierced in at the open windows,
and irradiated the picture of a lady hanging over the chimney-piece,
the only other decoration of the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother at five-and-twenty,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding to himself,
as his eyes enthusiastically followed the light to the portrait&rsquo;s
face, &ldquo;I hang up here, in order that visitors may admire my mother
in the bloom of her youth and beauty.&nbsp; My mother at fifty I hang
in the seclusion of my own chamber, as a remembrance sacred to me.&nbsp;
O!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you, Jarvis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These latter words he addressed to a clerk who had tapped at the
door, and now looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; I merely wished to mention that it&rsquo;s
gone ten, sir, and that there are several females in the Counting-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the wine-merchant, deepening in the pink
of his complexion and whitening in the white, &ldquo;are there several?&nbsp;
So many as several?&nbsp; I had better begin before there are more.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll see them one by one, Jarvis, in the order of their arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily entrenching himself in his easy-chair at the table behind
a great inkstand, having first placed a chair on the other side of the
table opposite his own seat, Mr. Wilding entered on his task with considerable
trepidation.</p>
<p>He ran the gauntlet that must be run on any such occasion.&nbsp;
There were the usual species of profoundly unsympathetic women, and
the usual species of much too sympathetic women.&nbsp; There were buccaneering
widows who came to seize him, and who griped umbrellas under their arms,
as if each umbrella were he, and each griper had got him.&nbsp; There
were towering maiden ladies who had seen better days, and who came armed
with clerical testimonials to their theology, as if he were Saint Peter
with his keys.&nbsp; There were gentle maiden ladies who came to marry
him.&nbsp; There were professional housekeepers, like non-commissioned
officers, who put him through his domestic exercise, instead of submitting
themselves to catechism.&nbsp; There were languid invalids, to whom
salary was not so much an object as the comforts of a private hospital.&nbsp;
There were sensitive creatures who burst into tears on being addressed,
and had to be restored with glasses of cold water.&nbsp; There were
some respondents who came two together, a highly promising one and a
wholly unpromising one: of whom the promising one answered all questions
charmingly, until it would at last appear that she was not a candidate
at all, but only the friend of the unpromising one, who had glowered
in absolute silence and apparent injury.</p>
<p>At last, when the good wine-merchant&rsquo;s simple heart was failing
him, there entered an applicant quite different from all the rest.&nbsp;
A woman, perhaps fifty, but looking younger, with a face remarkable
for placid cheerfulness, and a manner no less remarkable for its quiet
expression of equability of temper.&nbsp; Nothing in her dress could
have been changed to her advantage.&nbsp; Nothing in the noiseless self-possession
of her manner could have been changed to her advantage.&nbsp; Nothing
could have been in better unison with both, than her voice when she
answered the question: &ldquo;What name shall I have the pleasure of
noting down?&rdquo; with the words, &ldquo;My name is Sarah Goldstraw.&nbsp;
Mrs. Goldstraw.&nbsp; My husband has been dead many years, and we had
no family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-a-dozen questions had scarcely extracted as much to the purpose
from any one else.&nbsp; The voice dwelt so agreeably on Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s
ear as he made his note, that he was rather long about it.&nbsp; When
he looked up again, Mrs. Goldstraw&rsquo;s glance had naturally gone
round the room, and now returned to him from the chimney-piece.&nbsp;
Its expression was one of frank readiness to be questioned, and to answer
straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will excuse my asking you a few questions?&rdquo; said
the modest wine-merchant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, surely, sir.&nbsp; Or I should have no business here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you filled the station of housekeeper before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only once.&nbsp; I have lived with the same widow lady for
twelve years.&nbsp; Ever since I lost my husband.&nbsp; She was an invalid,
and is lately dead: which is the occasion of my now wearing black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt that she has left you the best credentials?&rdquo;
said Mr. Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I may say, the very best.&nbsp; I thought it would
save trouble, sir, if I wrote down the name and address of her representatives,
and brought it with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Laying a card on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You singularly remind me, Mrs. Goldstraw,&rdquo; said Wilding,
taking the card beside him, &ldquo;of a manner and tone of voice that
I was once acquainted with.&nbsp; Not of an individual&mdash;I feel
sure of that, though I cannot recall what it is I have in my mind&mdash;but
of a general bearing.&nbsp; I ought to add, it was a kind and pleasant
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, as she rejoined: &ldquo;At least, I am very glad of that,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the wine-merchant, thoughtfully repeating
his last phrase, with a momentary glance at his future housekeeper,
&ldquo;it was a kind and pleasant one.&nbsp; But that is the most I
can make of it.&nbsp; Memory is sometimes like a half-forgotten dream.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know how it may appear to you, Mrs. Goldstraw, but so
it appears to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably it appeared to Mrs. Goldstraw in a similar light, for she
quietly assented to the proposition.&nbsp; Mr. Wilding then offered
to put himself at once in communication with the gentlemen named upon
the card: a firm of proctors in Doctors&rsquo; Commons.&nbsp; To this,
Mrs. Goldstraw thankfully assented.&nbsp; Doctors&rsquo; Commons not
being far off, Mr. Wilding suggested the feasibility of Mrs. Goldstraw&rsquo;s
looking in again, say in three hours&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Mrs. Goldstraw
readily undertook to do so.&nbsp; In fine, the result of Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s
inquiries being eminently satisfactory, Mrs. Goldstraw was that afternoon
engaged (on her own perfectly fair terms) to come to-morrow and set
up her rest as housekeeper in Cripple Corner.</p>
<h3>THE HOUSEKEEPER SPEAKS</h3>
<p>On the next day Mrs. Goldstraw arrived, to enter on her domestic
duties.</p>
<p>Having settled herself in her own room, without troubling the servants,
and without wasting time, the new housekeeper announced herself as waiting
to be favoured with any instructions which her master might wish to
give her.&nbsp; The wine-merchant received Mrs. Goldstraw in the dining-room,
in which he had seen her on the previous day; and, the usual preliminary
civilities having passed on either side, the two sat down to take counsel
together on the affairs of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the meals, sir?&rdquo; said Mrs. Goldstraw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
I a large, or a small, number to provide for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can carry out a certain old-fashioned plan of mine,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Wilding, &ldquo;you will have a large number to provide
for.&nbsp; I am a lonely single man, Mrs. Goldstraw; and I hope to live
with all the persons in my employment as if they were members of my
family.&nbsp; Until that time comes, you will only have me, and the
new partner whom I expect immediately, to provide for.&nbsp; What my
partner&rsquo;s habits may be, I cannot yet say.&nbsp; But I may describe
myself as a man of regular hours, with an invariable appetite that you
may depend upon to an ounce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About breakfast, sir?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Goldstraw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
there anything particular&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, and left the sentence unfinished.&nbsp; Her eyes turned
slowly away from her master, and looked towards the chimney-piece.&nbsp;
If she had been a less excellent and experienced housekeeper, Mr. Wilding
might have fancied that her attention was beginning to wander at the
very outset of the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock is my breakfast-hour,&rdquo; he resumed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is one of my virtues to be never tired of broiled bacon, and
it is one of my vices to be habitually suspicious of the freshness of
eggs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Goldstraw looked back at him, still a little
divided between her master&rsquo;s chimney-piece and her master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I take tea,&rdquo; Mr. Wilding went on; &ldquo;and I am perhaps
rather nervous and fidgety about drinking it, within a certain time
after it is made.&nbsp; If my tea stands too long&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated, on his side, and left the sentence unfinished.&nbsp;
If he had not been engaged in discussing a subject of such paramount
interest to himself as his breakfast, Mrs. Goldstraw might have fancied
that his attention was beginning to wander at the very outset of the
interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your tea stands too long, sir&mdash;?&rdquo; said the housekeeper,
politely taking up her master&rsquo;s lost thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my tea stands too long,&rdquo; repeated the wine-merchant
mechanically, his mind getting farther and farther away from his breakfast,
and his eyes fixing themselves more and more inquiringly on his housekeeper&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my tea&mdash;Dear, dear me, Mrs. Goldstraw! what
<i>is</i> the manner and tone of voice that you remind me of?&nbsp;
It strikes me even more strongly to-day, than it did when I saw you
yesterday.&nbsp; What can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Goldstraw.</p>
<p>She said the words, evidently thinking while she spoke them of something
else.&nbsp; The wine-merchant, still looking at her inquiringly, observed
that her eyes wandered towards the chimney-piece once more.&nbsp; They
fixed on the portrait of his mother, which hung there, and looked at
it with that slight contraction of the brow which accompanies a scarcely
conscious effort of memory.&nbsp; Mr. Wilding remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My late dear mother, when she was five-and-twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Goldstraw thanked him with a movement of the head for being
at the pains to explain the picture, and said, with a cleared brow,
that it was the portrait of a very beautiful lady.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilding, falling back into his former perplexity, tried once
more to recover that lost recollection, associated so closely, and yet
so undiscoverably, with his new housekeeper&rsquo;s voice and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse my asking you a question which has nothing to do with
me or my breakfast,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I inquire if you
have ever occupied any other situation than the situation of housekeeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, sir.&nbsp; I began life as one of the nurses at the
Foundling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried the wine-merchant, pushing
back his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;By heaven!&nbsp; Their manner is the manner
you remind me of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an astonished look at him, Mrs. Goldstraw changed colour, checked
herself, turned her eyes upon the ground, and sat still and silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand that you were in the Foundling, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; I am not ashamed to own it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the name you now bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the name of Walter Wilding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lady&mdash;?&rdquo; Mrs. Goldstraw stopped short with
a look at the portrait which was now unmistakably a look of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean my mother,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;mother,&rdquo; repeated the housekeeper, a little
constrainedly, &ldquo;removed you from the Foundling?&nbsp; At what
age, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At between eleven and twelve years old.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite
a romantic adventure, Mrs. Goldstraw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told the story of the lady having spoken to him, while he sat
at dinner with the other boys in the Foundling, and of all that had
followed in his innocently communicative way.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor mother
could never have discovered me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if she had not
met with one of the matrons who pitied her.&nbsp; The matron consented
to touch the boy whose name was &lsquo;Walter Wilding&rsquo; as she
went round the dinner-tables&mdash;and so my mother discovered me again,
after having parted from me as an infant at the Foundling doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At those words Mrs. Goldstraw&rsquo;s hand, resting on the table,
dropped helplessly into her lap.&nbsp; She sat, looking at her new master,
with a face that had turned deadly pale, and with eyes that expressed
an unutterable dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; asked the wine-merchant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there something else in
the past time which I ought to associate with you?&nbsp; I remember
my mother telling me of another person at the Foundling, to whose kindness
she owed a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; When she first parted with me, as
an infant, one of the nurses informed her of the name that had been
given to me in the institution.&nbsp; You were that nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive me, sir&mdash;I was that nurse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better get back, sir (if I may make so bold as to say
so), to my duties in the house,&rdquo; said Mrs. Goldstraw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
breakfast-hour is eight.&nbsp; Do you lunch, or dine, in the middle
of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excessive pinkness which Mr. Bintrey had noticed in his client&rsquo;s
face began to appear there once more.&nbsp; Mr. Wilding put his hand
to his head, and mastered some momentary confusion in that quarter,
before he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Goldstraw,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are concealing
something from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper obstinately repeated, &ldquo;Please to favour me,
sir, by saying whether you lunch, or dine, in the middle of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I do in the middle of the day.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t enter into my household affairs, Mrs. Goldstraw, till
I know why you regret an act of kindness to my mother, which she always
spoke of gratefully to the end of her life.&nbsp; You are not doing
me a service by your silence.&nbsp; You are agitating me, you are alarming
me, you are bringing on the singing in my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand went up to his head again, and the pink in his face deepened
by a shade or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard, sir, on just entering your service,&rdquo;
said the housekeeper, &ldquo;to say what may cost me the loss of your
good will.&nbsp; Please to remember, end how it may, that I only speak
because you have insisted on my speaking, and because I see that I am
alarming you by my silence.&nbsp; When I told the poor lady, whose portrait
you have got there, the name by which her infant was christened in the
Foundling, I allowed myself to forget my duty, and dreadful consequences,
I am afraid, have followed from it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth,
as plainly as I can.&nbsp; A few months from the time when I had informed
the lady of her baby&rsquo;s name, there came to our institution in
the country another lady (a stranger), whose object was to adopt one
of our children.&nbsp; She brought the needful permission with her,
and after looking at a great many of the children, without being able
to make up her mind, she took a sudden fancy to one of the babies&mdash;a
boy&mdash;under my care.&nbsp; Try, pray try, to compose yourself, sir!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no use disguising it any longer.&nbsp; The child the stranger
took away was the child of that lady whose portrait hangs there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilding started to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
he cried out, vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you talking about?&nbsp;
What absurd story are you telling me now?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s her portrait!&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t I told you so already?&nbsp; The portrait of my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that unhappy lady removed you from the Foundling, in
after years,&rdquo; said Mrs. Goldstraw, gently, &ldquo;she was the
victim, and you were the victim, sir, of a dreadful mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped back into his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;The room goes round
with me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My head! my head!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The housekeeper rose in alarm, and opened the windows.&nbsp; Before
she could get to the door to call for help, a sudden burst of tears
relieved the oppression which had at first almost appeared to threaten
his life.&nbsp; He signed entreatingly to Mrs. Goldstraw not to leave
him.&nbsp; She waited until the paroxysm of weeping had worn itself
out.&nbsp; He raised his head as he recovered himself, and looked at
her with the angry unreasoning suspicion of a weak man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistake?&rdquo; he said, wildly repeating her last word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do I know you are not mistaken yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no hope that I am mistaken, sir.&nbsp; I will tell
you why, when you are better fit to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone in which he spoke warned Mrs. Goldstraw that it would be
cruel kindness to let him comfort himself a moment longer with the vain
hope that she might be wrong.&nbsp; A few words more would end it, and
those few words she determined to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the child of
the lady whose portrait hangs there, was adopted in its infancy, and
taken away by a stranger.&nbsp; I am as certain of what I say as that
I am now sitting here, obliged to distress you, sir, sorely against
my will.&nbsp; Please to carry your mind on, now, to about three months
after that time.&nbsp; I was then at the Foundling, in London, waiting
to take some children to our institution in the country.&nbsp; There
was a question that day about naming an infant&mdash;a boy&mdash;who
had just been received.&nbsp; We generally named them out of the Directory.&nbsp;
On this occasion, one of the gentlemen who managed the Hospital happened
to be looking over the Register.&nbsp; He noticed that the name of the
baby who had been adopted (&lsquo;Walter Wilding&rsquo;) was scratched
out&mdash;for the reason, of course, that the child had been removed
for good from our care.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a name to let,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give it to the new foundling who has been received
to-day.&rsquo;&nbsp; The name was given, and the child was christened.&nbsp;
You, sir, were that child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wine-merchant&rsquo;s head dropped on his breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was that child!&rdquo; he said to himself, trying helplessly to fix
the idea in his mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was that child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very long after you had been received into the Institution,
sir,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Goldstraw, &ldquo;I left my situation there,
to be married.&nbsp; If you will remember that, and if you can give
your mind to it, you will see for yourself how the mistake happened.&nbsp;
Between eleven and twelve years passed before the lady, whom you have
believed to be your mother, returned to the Foundling, to find her son,
and to remove him to her own home.&nbsp; The lady only knew that her
infant had been called &lsquo;Walter Wilding.&rsquo;&nbsp; The matron
who took pity on her, could but point out the only &lsquo;Walter Wilding&rsquo;
known in the Institution.&nbsp; I, who might have set the matter right,
was far away from the Foundling and all that belonged to it.&nbsp; There
was nothing&mdash;there was really nothing that could prevent this terrible
mistake from taking place.&nbsp; I feel for you&mdash;I do indeed, sir!&nbsp;
You must think&mdash;and with reason&mdash;that it was in an evil hour
that I came here (innocently enough, I&rsquo;m sure), to apply for your
housekeeper&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; I feel as if I was to blame&mdash;I
feel as if I ought to have had more self-command.&nbsp; If I had only
been able to keep my face from showing you what that portrait and what
your own words put into my mind, you need never, to your dying day,
have known what you know now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilding looked up suddenly.&nbsp; The inbred honesty of the man
rose in protest against the housekeeper&rsquo;s last words.&nbsp; His
mind seemed to steady itself, for the moment, under the shock that had
fallen on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you would have concealed this from
me if you could?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I should always tell the truth, sir, if I was asked,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Goldstraw.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I know it is better for <i>me</i>
that I should not have a secret of this sort weighing on my mind.&nbsp;
But is it better for <i>you</i>?&nbsp; What use can it serve now&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What use?&nbsp; Why, good Lord! if your story is true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I have told it, sir, as I am now situated, if it had
not been true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the wine-merchant.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must make allowance for me.&nbsp; This dreadful discovery is something
I can&rsquo;t realise even yet.&nbsp; We loved each other so dearly&mdash;I
felt so fondly that I was her son.&nbsp; She died, Mrs. Goldstraw, in
my arms&mdash;she died blessing me as only a mother <i>could</i> have
blessed me.&nbsp; And now, after all these years, to be told she was
<i>not</i> my mother!&nbsp; O me, O me!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
I am saying!&rdquo; he cried, as the impulse of self-control under which
he had spoken a moment since, flickered, and died out.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was not this dreadful grief&mdash;it was something else that I had it
in my mind to speak of.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; You surprised me&mdash;you
wounded me just now.&nbsp; You talked as if you would have hidden this
from me, if you could.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk in that way again.&nbsp;
It would have been a crime to have hidden it.&nbsp; You mean well, I
know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to distress you&mdash;you are a kind-hearted
woman.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t remember what my position is.&nbsp;
She left me all that I possess, in the firm persuasion that I was her
son.&nbsp; I am not her son.&nbsp; I have taken the place, I have innocently
got the inheritance of another man.&nbsp; He must be found!&nbsp; How
do I know he is not at this moment in misery, without bread to eat?&nbsp;
He must be found!&nbsp; My only hope of bearing up against the shock
that has fallen on me, is the hope of doing something which <i>she</i>
would have approved.&nbsp; You must know more, Mrs. Goldstraw, than
you have told me yet.&nbsp; Who was the stranger who adopted the child?&nbsp;
You must have heard the lady&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard it, sir.&nbsp; I have never seen her, or heard
of her, since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say nothing when she took the child away?&nbsp; Search
your memory.&nbsp; She must have said something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing, sir, that I can remember.&nbsp; It was a miserably
bad season, that year; and many of the children were suffering from
it.&nbsp; When she took the baby away, the lady said to me, laughing,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed about his health.&nbsp; He will be brought
up in a better climate than this&mdash;I am going to take him to Switzerland.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Switzerland?&nbsp; What part of Switzerland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that faint clue!&rdquo; said Mr. Wilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
a quarter of a century has passed since the child was taken away!&nbsp;
What am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t take offence at my freedom, sir,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Goldstraw; &ldquo;but why should you distress yourself about
what is to be done?&nbsp; He may not be alive now, for anything you
know.&nbsp; And, if he is alive, it&rsquo;s not likely he can be in
any distress.&nbsp; The, lady who adopted him was a bred and born lady&mdash;it
was easy to see that.&nbsp; And she must have satisfied them at the
Foundling that she could provide for the child, or they would never
have let her take him away.&nbsp; If I was in your place, sir&mdash;please
to excuse my saying so&mdash;I should comfort myself with remembering
that I had loved that poor lady whose portrait you have got there&mdash;truly
loved her as my mother, and that she had truly loved me as her son.&nbsp;
All she gave to you, she gave for the sake of that love.&nbsp; It never
altered while she lived; and it won&rsquo;t alter, I&rsquo;m sure, as
long as <i>you</i> live.&nbsp; How can you have a better right, sir,
to keep what you have got than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s immovable honesty saw the fallacy in his housekeeper&rsquo;s
point of view at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
<i>because</i> I loved her that I feel it a duty&mdash;a sacred duty&mdash;to
do justice to her son.&nbsp; If he is a living man, I must find him:
for my own sake, as well as for his.&nbsp; I shall break down under
this dreadful trial, unless I employ myself&mdash;actively, instantly
employ myself&mdash;in doing what my conscience tells me ought to be
done.&nbsp; I must speak to my lawyer; I must set my lawyer at work
before I sleep to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He approached a tube in the wall
of the room, and called down through it to the office below.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave
me for a little, Mrs. Goldstraw,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;I shall be
more composed, I shall be better able to speak to you later in the day.&nbsp;
We shall get on well&mdash;I hope we shall get on well together&mdash;in
spite of what has happened.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t your fault; I know
it isn&rsquo;t your fault.&nbsp; There! there! shake hands; and&mdash;and
do the best you can in the house&mdash;I can&rsquo;t talk about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened as Mrs. Goldstraw advanced towards it; and Mr. Jarvis
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; said the wine-merchant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Say I want to see him directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk unconsciously suspended the execution of the order, by
announcing &ldquo;Mr. Vendale,&rdquo; and showing in the new partner
in the firm of Wilding and Co.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me for one moment, George Vendale,&rdquo; said
Wilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a word to say to Jarvis.&nbsp; Send for
Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;&ldquo;send at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis laid a letter on the table before he left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From our correspondents at Neuch&acirc;tel, I think, sir.&nbsp;
The letter has got the Swiss postmark.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>NEW CHARACTERS ON THE SCENE</h3>
<p>The words, &ldquo;The Swiss Postmark,&rdquo; following so soon upon
the housekeeper&rsquo;s reference to Switzerland, wrought Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s
agitation to such a remarkable height, that his new partner could not
decently make a pretence of letting it pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilding,&rdquo; he asked hurriedly, and yet stopping short
and glancing around as if for some visible cause of his state of mind:
&ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good George Vendale,&rdquo; returned the wine-merchant,
giving his hand with an appealing look, rather as if he wanted help
to get over some obstacle, than as if he gave it in welcome or salutation:
&ldquo;my good George Vendale, so much is the matter, that I shall never
be myself again.&nbsp; It is impossible that I can ever be myself again.&nbsp;
For, in fact, I am not myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new partner, a brown-cheeked handsome fellow, of about his own
age, with a quick determined eye and an impulsive manner, retorted with
natural astonishment: &ldquo;Not yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not what I supposed myself to be,&rdquo; said Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in the name of wonder, <i>did</i> you suppose yourself
to be that you are not?&rdquo; was the rejoinder, delivered with a cheerful
frankness, inviting confidence from a more reticent man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
may ask without impertinence, now that we are partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There again!&rdquo; cried Wilding, leaning back in his chair,
with a lost look at the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Partners!&nbsp; I had no
right to come into this business.&nbsp; It was never meant for me.&nbsp;
My mother never meant it should be mine.&nbsp; I mean, his mother meant
it should be his&mdash;if I mean anything&mdash;or if I am anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; urged his partner, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, and taking possession of him with that calm confidence which
inspires a strong nature when it honestly desires to aid a weak one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever has gone wrong, has gone wrong through no fault of yours,
I am very sure.&nbsp; I was not in this counting-house with you, under
the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, for three years, to doubt you, Wilding.&nbsp;
We were not younger men than we are, together, for that.&nbsp; Let me
begin our partnership by being a serviceable partner, and setting right
whatever is wrong.&nbsp; Has that letter anything to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said Wilding, with his hand to his temple.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There again!&nbsp; My head!&nbsp; I was forgetting the coincidence.&nbsp;
The Swiss postmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a second glance I see that the letter is unopened, so it
is not very likely to have much to do with the matter,&rdquo; said Vendale,
with comforting composure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it for you, or for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us,&rdquo; said Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I open it and read it aloud, to get it out of our
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter is only from our champagne-making friends, the
house at Neuch&acirc;tel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Sir.&nbsp; We are in receipt
of yours of the 28th ult., informing us that you have taken your Mr.
Vendale into partnership, whereon we beg you to receive the assurance
of our felicitations.&nbsp; Permit us to embrace the occasion of specially
commanding to you M. Jules Obenreizer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilding looked up in quick apprehension, and cried, &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible sort of name,&rdquo; returned his partner, slightly&mdash;&ldquo;Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&mdash;Of specially commanding to you M. Jules Obenreizer, of
Soho Square, London (north side), henceforth fully accredited as our
agent, and who has already had the honour of making the acquaintance
of your Mr. Vendale, in his (said M. Obenreizer&rsquo;s) native country,
Switzerland.&rsquo;&nbsp; To be sure! pooh pooh, what have I been thinking
of!&nbsp; I remember now; &lsquo;when travelling with his niece.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; Vendale had so slurred the last
word, that Wilding had not heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When travelling with his Niece.&nbsp; Obenreizer&rsquo;s Niece,&rdquo;
said Vendale, in a somewhat superfluously lucid manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Niece
of Obenreizer.&nbsp; (I met them in my first Swiss tour, travelled a
little with them, and lost them for two years; met them again, my Swiss
tour before last, and have lost them ever since.)&nbsp; Obenreizer.&nbsp;
Niece of Obenreizer.&nbsp; To be sure!&nbsp; Possible sort of name,
after all!&nbsp; &lsquo;M. Obenreizer is in possession of our absolute
confidence, and we do not doubt you will esteem his merits.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Duly signed by the House, &lsquo;Defresnier et Cie.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very
well.&nbsp; I undertake to see M. Obenreizer presently, and clear him
out of the way.&nbsp; That clears the Swiss postmark out of the way.&nbsp;
So now, my dear Wilding, tell me what I can clear out of <i>your</i>
way, and I&rsquo;ll find a way to clear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than ready and grateful to be thus taken charge of, the honest
wine-merchant wrung his partner&rsquo;s hand, and, beginning his tale
by pathetically declaring himself an Impostor, told it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on this matter, no doubt, that you were sending for
Bintrey when I came in?&rdquo; said his partner, after reflecting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has experience and a shrewd head; I shall be anxious to
know his opinion.&nbsp; It is bold and hazardous in me to give you mine
before I know his, but I am not good at holding back.&nbsp; Plainly,
then, I do not see these circumstances as you see them.&nbsp; I do not
see your position as you see it.&nbsp; As to your being an Impostor,
my dear Wilding, that is simply absurd, because no man can be that without
being a consenting party to an imposition.&nbsp; Clearly you never were
so.&nbsp; As to your enrichment by the lady who believed you to be her
son, and whom you were forced to believe, on her showing, to be your
mother, consider whether that did not arise out of the personal relations
between you.&nbsp; You gradually became much attached to her; she gradually
became much attached to you.&nbsp; It was on you, personally you, as
I see the case, that she conferred these worldly advantages; it was
from her, personally her, that you took them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She supposed me,&rdquo; objected Wilding, shaking his head,
&ldquo;to have a natural claim upon her, which I had not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must admit that,&rdquo; replied his partner, &ldquo;to be
true.&nbsp; But if she had made the discovery that you have made, six
months before she died, do you think it would have cancelled the years
you were together, and the tenderness that each of you had conceived
for the other, each on increasing knowledge of the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I think,&rdquo; said Wilding, simply but stoutly holding
to the bare fact, &ldquo;can no more change the truth than it can bring
down the sky.&nbsp; The truth is that I stand possessed of what was
meant for another man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be dead,&rdquo; said Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be alive,&rdquo; said Wilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if
he is alive, have I not&mdash;innocently, I grant you innocently&mdash;robbed
him of enough?&nbsp; Have I not robbed him of all the happy time that
I enjoyed in his stead?&nbsp; Have I not robbed him of the exquisite
delight that filled my soul when that dear lady,&rdquo; stretching his
hand towards the picture, &ldquo;told me she was my mother?&nbsp; Have
I not robbed him of all the care she lavished on me?&nbsp; Have I not
even robbed him of all the devotion and duty that I so proudly gave
to her?&nbsp; Therefore it is that I ask myself, George Vendale, and
I ask you, where is he?&nbsp; What has become of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must try to find out who can tell.&nbsp; I must institute
inquiries.&nbsp; I must never desist from prosecuting inquiries.&nbsp;
I will live upon the interest of my share&mdash;I ought to say his share&mdash;in
this business, and will lay up the rest for him.&nbsp; When I find him,
I may perhaps throw myself upon his generosity; but I will yield up
all to him.&nbsp; I will, I swear.&nbsp; As I loved and honoured her,&rdquo;
said Wilding, reverently kissing his hand towards the picture, and then
covering his eyes with it.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I loved and honoured her,
and have a world of reasons to be grateful to her!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
so broke down again.</p>
<p>His partner rose from the chair he had occupied, and stood beside
him with a hand softly laid upon his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Walter,
I knew you before to-day to be an upright man, with a pure conscience
and a fine heart.&nbsp; It is very fortunate for me that I have the
privilege to travel on in life so near to so trustworthy a man.&nbsp;
I am thankful for it.&nbsp; Use me as your right hand, and rely upon
me to the death.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think the worse of me if I protest
to you that my uppermost feeling at present is a confused, you may call
it an unreasonable, one.&nbsp; I feel far more pity for the lady and
for you, because you did not stand in your supposed relations, than
I can feel for the unknown man (if he ever became a man), because he
was unconsciously displaced.&nbsp; You have done well in sending for
Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp; What I think will be a part of his advice, I know
is the whole of mine.&nbsp; Do not move a step in this serious matter
precipitately.&nbsp; The secret must be kept among us with great strictness,
for to part with it lightly would be to invite fraudulent claims, to
encourage a host of knaves, to let loose a flood of perjury and plotting.&nbsp;
I have no more to say now, Walter, than to remind you that you sold
me a share in your business, expressly to save yourself from more work
than your present health is fit for, and that I bought it expressly
to do work, and mean to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words, and a parting grip of his partner&rsquo;s shoulder
that gave them the best emphasis they could have had, George Vendale
betook himself presently to the counting-house, and presently afterwards
to the address of M. Jules Obenreizer.</p>
<p>As he turned into Soho Square, and directed his steps towards its
north side, a deepened colour shot across his sun-browned face, which
Wilding, if he had been a better observer, or had been less occupied
with his own trouble, might have noticed when his partner read aloud
a certain passage in their Swiss correspondent&rsquo;s letter, which
he had not read so distinctly as the rest.</p>
<p>A curious colony of mountaineers has long been enclosed within that
small flat London district of Soho.&nbsp; Swiss watchmakers, Swiss silver-chasers,
Swiss jewellers, Swiss importers of Swiss musical boxes and Swiss toys
of various kinds, draw close together there.&nbsp; Swiss professors
of music, painting, and languages; Swiss artificers in steady work;
Swiss couriers, and other Swiss servants chronically out of place; industrious
Swiss laundresses and clear-starchers; mysteriously existing Swiss of
both sexes; Swiss creditable and Swiss discreditable; Swiss to be trusted
by all means, and Swiss to be trusted by no means; these diverse Swiss
particles are attracted to a centre in the district of Soho.&nbsp; Shabby
Swiss eating-houses, coffee-houses, and lodging-houses, Swiss drinks
and dishes, Swiss service for Sundays, and Swiss schools for week-days,
are all to be found there.&nbsp; Even the native-born English taverns
drive a sort of broken-English trade; announcing in their windows Swiss
whets and drams, and sheltering in their bars Swiss skirmishes of love
and animosity on most nights in the year.</p>
<p>When the new partner in Wilding and Co. rang the bell of a door bearing
the blunt inscription OBENREIZER on a brass plate&mdash;the inner door
of a substantial house, whose ground story was devoted to the sale of
Swiss clocks&mdash;he passed at once into domestic Switzerland.&nbsp;
A white-tiled stove for winter-time filled the fireplace of the room
into which he was shown, the room&rsquo;s bare floor was laid together
in a neat pattern of several ordinary woods, the room had a prevalent
air of surface bareness and much scrubbing; and the little square of
flowery carpet by the sofa, and the velvet chimney-board with its capacious
clock and vases of artificial flowers, contended with that tone, as
if, in bringing out the whole effect, a Parisian had adapted a dairy
to domestic purposes.</p>
<p>Mimic water was dropping off a mill-wheel under the clock.&nbsp;
The visitor had not stood before it, following it with his eyes, a minute,
when M. Obenreizer, at his elbow, startled him by saying, in very good
English, very slightly clipped: &ldquo;How do you do?&nbsp; So glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hear you come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&nbsp; Sit, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Releasing his visitor&rsquo;s two arms, which he had lightly pinioned
at the elbows by way of embrace, M. Obenreizer also sat, remarking,
with a smile: &ldquo;You are well?&nbsp; So glad!&rdquo; and touching
his elbows again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Vendale, after exchange of
salutations, &ldquo;whether you may yet have heard of me from your House
at Neuch&acirc;tel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In connection with Wilding and Co.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, surely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not odd that I should come to you, in London here, as
one of the Firm of Wilding and Co., to pay the Firm&rsquo;s respects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&nbsp; What did I always observe when we were on
the mountains?&nbsp; We call them vast; but the world is so little.&nbsp;
So little is the world, that one cannot keep away from persons.&nbsp;
There are so few persons in the world, that they continually cross and
re-cross.&nbsp; So very little is the world, that one cannot get rid
of a person.&nbsp; Not,&rdquo; touching his elbows again, with an ingratiatory
smile, &ldquo;that one would desire to get rid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, M. Obenreizer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please call me, in your country, Mr.&nbsp; I call myself so,
for I love your country.&nbsp; If I <i>could</i> be English!&nbsp; But
I am born.&nbsp; And you?&nbsp; Though descended from so fine a family,
you have had the condescension to come into trade?&nbsp; Stop though.&nbsp;
Wines?&nbsp; Is it trade in England or profession?&nbsp; Not fine art?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Obenreizer,&rdquo; returned Vendale, somewhat out of countenance,
&ldquo;I was but a silly young fellow, just of age, when I first had
the pleasure of travelling with you, and when you and I and Mademoiselle
your niece&mdash;who is well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; Who is well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Shared some slight glacier dangers together.&nbsp;
If, with a boy&rsquo;s vanity, I rather vaunted my family, I hope I
did so as a kind of introduction of myself.&nbsp; It was very weak,
and in very bad taste; but perhaps you know our English proverb, &lsquo;Live
and Learn.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make too much of it,&rdquo; returned the Swiss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what the devil!&nbsp; After all, yours <i>was</i> a fine
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Vendale&rsquo;s laugh betrayed a little vexation as he rejoined:
&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I was strongly attached to my parents, and when we
first travelled together, Mr. Obenreizer, I was in the first flush of
coming into what my father and mother left me.&nbsp; So I hope it may
have been, after all, more youthful openness of speech and heart than
boastfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All openness of speech and heart!&nbsp; No boastfulness!&rdquo;
cried Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You tax yourself too heavily.&nbsp; You
tax yourself, my faith! as if you was your Government taxing you!&nbsp;
Besides, it commenced with me.&nbsp; I remember, that evening in the
boat upon the lake, floating among the reflections of the mountains
and valleys, the crags and pine woods, which were my earliest remembrance,
I drew a word-picture of my sordid childhood.&nbsp; Of our poor hut,
by the waterfall which my mother showed to travellers; of the cow-shed
where I slept with the cow; of my idiot half-brother always sitting
at the door, or limping down the Pass to beg; of my half-sister always
spinning, and resting her enormous go&icirc;tre on a great stone; of
my being a famished naked little wretch of two or three years, when
they were men and women with hard hands to beat me, I, the only child
of my father&rsquo;s second marriage&mdash;if it even was a marriage.&nbsp;
What more natural than for you to compare notes with me, and say, &lsquo;We
are as one by age; at that same time I sat upon my mother&rsquo;s lap
in my father&rsquo;s carriage, rolling through the rich English streets,
all luxury surrounding me, all squalid poverty kept far from me.&nbsp;
Such is <i>my</i> earliest remembrance as opposed to yours!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Obenreizer was a black-haired young man of a dark complexion,
through whose swarthy skin no red glow ever shone.&nbsp; When colour
would have come into another cheek, a hardly discernible beat would
come into his, as if the machinery for bringing up the ardent blood
were there, but the machinery were dry.&nbsp; He was robustly made,
well proportioned, and had handsome features.&nbsp; Many would have
perceived that some surface change in him would have set them more at
their ease with him, without being able to define what change.&nbsp;
If his lips could have been made much thicker, and his neck much thinner,
they would have found their want supplied.</p>
<p>But the great Obenreizer peculiarity was, that a certain nameless
film would come over his eyes&mdash;apparently by the action of his
own will&mdash;which would impenetrably veil, not only from those tellers
of tales, but from his face at large, every expression save one of attention.&nbsp;
It by no means followed that his attention should be wholly given to
the person with whom he spoke, or even wholly bestowed on present sounds
and objects.&nbsp; Rather, it was a comprehensive watchfulness of everything
he had in his own mind, and everything that he knew to be, or suspected
to be, in the minds of other men.</p>
<p>At this stage of the conversation, Mr. Obenreizer&rsquo;s film came
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The object of my present visit,&rdquo; said Vendale, &ldquo;is,
I need hardly say, to assure you of the friendliness of Wilding and
Co., and of the goodness of your credit with us, and of our desire to
be of service to you.&nbsp; We hope shortly to offer you our hospitality.&nbsp;
Things are not quite in train with us yet, for my partner, Mr. Wilding,
is reorganising the domestic part of our establishment, and is interrupted
by some private affairs.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know Mr. Wilding, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Obenreizer did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come together soon.&nbsp; He will be glad to have
made your acquaintance, and I think I may predict that you will be glad
to have made his.&nbsp; You have not been long established in London,
I suppose, Mr. Obenreizer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only now that I have undertaken this agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle your niece&mdash;is&mdash;not married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Vendale glanced about him, as if for any tokens of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, and where, might I have the honour of recalling myself
to her remembrance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Obenreizer, discarding his film and touching his visitor&rsquo;s
elbows as before, said lightly: &ldquo;Come up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fluttered enough by the suddenness with which the interview he had
sought was coming upon him after all, George Vendale followed up-stairs.&nbsp;
In a room over the chamber he had just quitted&mdash;a room also Swiss-appointed&mdash;a
young lady sat near one of three windows, working at an embroidery-frame;
and an older lady sat with her face turned close to another white-tiled
stove (though it was summer, and the stove was not lighted), cleaning
gloves.&nbsp; The young lady wore an unusual quantity of fair bright
hair, very prettily braided about a rather rounder white forehead than
the average English type, and so her face might have been a shade&mdash;or
say a light&mdash;rounder than the average English face, and her figure
slightly rounder than the figure of the average English girl at nineteen.&nbsp;
A remarkable indication of freedom and grace of limb, in her quiet attitude,
and a wonderful purity and freshness of colour in her dimpled face and
bright gray eyes, seemed fraught with mountain air.&nbsp; Switzerland
too, though the general fashion of her dress was English, peeped out
of the fanciful bodice she wore, and lurked in the curious clocked red
stocking, and in its little silver-buckled shoe.&nbsp; As to the elder
lady, sitting with her feet apart upon the lower brass ledge of the
stove, supporting a lap-full of gloves while she cleaned one stretched
on her left hand, she was a true Swiss impersonation of another kind;
from the breadth of her cushion-like back, and the ponderosity of her
respectable legs (if the word be admissible), to the black velvet band
tied tightly round her throat for the repression of a rising tendency
to go&icirc;tre; or, higher still, to her great copper-coloured gold
ear-rings; or, higher still, to her head-dress of black gauze stretched
on wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Marguerite,&rdquo; said Obenreizer to the young lady,
&ldquo;do you recollect this gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she answered, rising from her seat, surprised
and a little confused: &ldquo;it is Mr. Vendale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Permit
me, Mr. Vendale.&nbsp; Madame Dor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder lady by the stove, with the glove stretched on her left
hand, like a glover&rsquo;s sign, half got up, half looked over her
broad shoulder, and wholly plumped down again and rubbed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Dor,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, smiling, &ldquo;is so
kind as to keep me free from stain or tear.&nbsp; Madame Dor humours
my weakness for being always neat, and devotes her time to removing
every one of my specks and spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Dor, with the stretched glove in the air, and her eyes closely
scrutinizing its palm, discovered a tough spot in Mr. Obenreizer at
that instant, and rubbed hard at him.&nbsp; George Vendale took his
seat by the embroidery-frame (having first taken the fair right hand
that his entrance had checked), and glanced at the gold cross that dipped
into the bodice, with something of the devotion of a pilgrim who had
reached his shrine at last.&nbsp; Obenreizer stood in the middle of
the room with his thumbs in his waistcoat-pockets, and became filmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was saying down-stairs, Miss Obenreizer,&rdquo; observed
Vendale, &ldquo;that the world is so small a place, that people cannot
escape one another.&nbsp; I have found it much too large for me since
I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you travelled so far, then?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far, for I have only gone back to Switzerland each
year; but I could have wished&mdash;and indeed I have wished very often&mdash;that
the little world did not afford such opportunities for long escapes
as it does.&nbsp; If it had been less, I might have found my follow-travellers
sooner, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pretty Marguerite coloured, and very slightly glanced in the
direction of Madame Dor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find us at length, Mr. Vendale.&nbsp; Perhaps you may
lose us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust not.&nbsp; The curious coincidence that has enabled
me to find you, encourages me to hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that coincidence, sir, if you please?&rdquo;&nbsp;
A dainty little native touch in this turn of speech, and in its tone,
made it perfectly captivating, thought George Vendale, when again he
noticed an instantaneous glance towards Madame Dor.&nbsp; A caution
seemed to be conveyed in it, rapid flash though it was; so he quietly
took heed of Madame Dor from that time forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that I happen to have become a partner in a House of
business in London, to which Mr. Obenreizer happens this very day to
be expressly recommended: and that, too, by another house of business
in Switzerland, in which (as it turns out) we both have a commercial
interest.&nbsp; He has not told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Obenreizer, striking in, filmless.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I had not told Miss Marguerite.&nbsp; The world is
so small and so monotonous that a surprise is worth having in such a
little jog-trot place.&nbsp; It is as he tells you, Miss Marguerite.&nbsp;
He, of so fine a family, and so proudly bred, has condescended to trade.&nbsp;
To trade!&nbsp; Like us poor peasants who have risen from ditches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud crept over the fair brow, and she cast down her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is good for trade!&rdquo; pursued Obenreizer, enthusiastically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It ennobles trade!&nbsp; It is the misfortune of trade, it is
its vulgarity, that any low people&mdash;for example, we poor peasants&mdash;may
take to it and climb by it.&nbsp; See you, my dear Vendale!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He spoke with great energy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The father of Miss Marguerite,
my eldest half-brother, more than two times your age or mine, if living
now, wandered without shoes, almost without rags, from that wretched
Pass&mdash;wandered&mdash;wandered&mdash;got to be fed with the mules
and dogs at an Inn in the main valley far away&mdash;got to be Boy there&mdash;got
to be Ostler&mdash;got to be Waiter&mdash;got to be Cook&mdash;got to
be Landlord.&nbsp; As Landlord, he took me (could he take the idiot
beggar his brother, or the spinning monstrosity his sister?) to put
as pupil to the famous watchmaker, his neighbour and friend.&nbsp; His
wife dies when Miss Marguerite is born.&nbsp; What is his will, and
what are his words to me, when he dies, she being between girl and woman?&nbsp;
&lsquo;All for Marguerite, except so much by the year for you.&nbsp;
You are young, but I make her your ward, for you were of the obscurest
and the poorest peasantry, and so was I, and so was her mother; we were
abject peasants all, and you will remember it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The thing
is equally true of most of my countrymen, now in trade in this your
London quarter of Soho.&nbsp; Peasants once; low-born drudging Swiss
Peasants.&nbsp; Then how good and great for trade:&rdquo; here, from
having been warm, he became playfully jubilant, and touched the young
wine-merchant&rsquo;s elbows again with his light embrace: &ldquo;to
be exalted by gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; said Marguerite, with a flushed
cheek, and a look away from the visitor, that was almost defiant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think it is as much exalted by us peasants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, fie, Miss Marguerite,&rdquo; said Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
speak in proud England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak in proud earnest,&rdquo; she answered, quietly resuming
her work, &ldquo;and I am not English, but a Swiss peasant&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dismissal of the subject in her words, which Vendale
could not contend against.&nbsp; He only said in an earnest manner,
&ldquo;I most heartily agree with you, Miss Obenreizer, and I have already
said so, as Mr. Obenreizer will bear witness,&rdquo; which he by no
means did, &ldquo;in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Vendale&rsquo;s eyes were quick eyes, and sharply watching Madame
Dor by times, noted something in the broad back view of that lady.&nbsp;
There was considerable pantomimic expression in her glove-cleaning.&nbsp;
It had been very softly done when he spoke with Marguerite, or it had
altogether stopped, like the action of a listener.&nbsp; When Obenreizer&rsquo;s
peasant-speech came to an end, she rubbed most vigorously, as if applauding
it.&nbsp; And once or twice, as the glove (which she always held before
her a little above her face) turned in the air, or as this finger went
down, or that went up, he even fancied that it made some telegraphic
communication to Obenreizer: whose back was certainly never turned upon
it, though he did not seem at all to heed it.</p>
<p>Vendale observed too, that in Marguerite&rsquo;s dismissal of the
subject twice forced upon him to his misrepresentation, there was an
indignant treatment of her guardian which she tried to cheek: as though
she would have flamed out against him, but for the influence of fear.&nbsp;
He also observed&mdash;though this was not much&mdash;that he never
advanced within the distance of her at which he first placed himself:
as though there were limits fixed between them.&nbsp; Neither had he
ever spoken of her without the prefix &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; though whenever
he uttered it, it was with the faintest trace of an air of mockery.&nbsp;
And now it occurred to Vendale for the first time that something curious
in the man, which he had never before been able to define, was definable
as a certain subtle essence of mockery that eluded touch or analysis.&nbsp;
He felt convinced that Marguerite was in some sort a prisoner as to
her freewill&mdash;though she held her own against those two combined,
by the force of her character, which was nevertheless inadequate to
her release.&nbsp; To feel convinced of this, was not to feel less disposed
to love her than he had always been.&nbsp; In a word, he was desperately
in love with her, and thoroughly determined to pursue the opportunity
which had opened at last.</p>
<p>For the present, he merely touched upon the pleasure that Wilding
and Co. would soon have in entreating Miss Obenreizer to honour their
establishment with her presence&mdash;a curious old place, though a
bachelor house withal&mdash;and so did not protract his visit beyond
such a visit&rsquo;s ordinary length.&nbsp; Going down-stairs, conducted
by his host, he found the Obenreizer counting-house at the back of the
entrance-hall, and several shabby men in outlandish garments hanging
about, whom Obenreizer put aside that he might pass, with a few words
in <i>patois</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Countrymen,&rdquo; he explained, as he attended Vendale to
the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor compatriots.&nbsp; Grateful and attached,
like dogs!&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; To meet again.&nbsp; So glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more light touches on his elbows dismissed him into the street.</p>
<p>Sweet Marguerite at her frame, and Madame Dor&rsquo;s broad back
at her telegraph, floated before him to Cripple Corner.&nbsp; On his
arrival there, Wilding was closeted with Bintrey.&nbsp; The cellar doors
happening to be open, Vendale lighted a candle in a cleft stick, and
went down for a cellarous stroll.&nbsp; Graceful Marguerite floated
before him faithfully, but Madame Dor&rsquo;s broad back remained outside.</p>
<p>The vaults were very spacious, and very old.&nbsp; There had been
a stone crypt down there, when bygones were not bygones; some said,
part of a monkish refectory; some said, of a chapel; some said, of a
Pagan temple.&nbsp; It was all one now.&nbsp; Let who would make what
he liked of a crumbled pillar and a broken arch or so.&nbsp; Old Time
had made what <i>he</i> liked of it, and was quite indifferent to contradiction.</p>
<p>The close air, the musty smell, and the thunderous rumbling in the
streets above, as being, out of the routine of ordinary life, went well
enough with the picture of pretty Marguerite holding her own against
those two.&nbsp; So Vendale went on until, at a turning in the vaults,
he saw a light like the light he carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; You are here, are you, Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t it rather to go, &lsquo;O!&nbsp; <i>You&rsquo;re</i>
here, are you, Master George?&rsquo;&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s my business
to be here.&nbsp; But it ain&rsquo;t yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grumble, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t grumble,&rdquo; returned the
Cellarman.&nbsp; &ldquo;If anything grumbles, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
took in through the pores; it ain&rsquo;t me.&nbsp; Have a care as something
in you don&rsquo;t begin a grumbling, Master George.&nbsp; Stop here
long enough for the wapours to work, and they&rsquo;ll be at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His present occupation consisted of poking his head into the bins,
making measurements and mental calculations, and entering them in a
rhinoceros-hide-looking note-book, like a piece of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be at it,&rdquo; he resumed, laying the wooden
rod that he measured with across two casks, entering his last calculation,
and straightening his back, &ldquo;trust &lsquo;em!&nbsp; And so you&rsquo;ve
regularly come into the business, Master George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regularly.&nbsp; I hope you don&rsquo;t object, Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t, bless you.&nbsp; But Wapours objects
that you&rsquo;re too young.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re both on you too young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall got over that objection day by day, Joey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Master George; but I shall day by day get over the objection
that I&rsquo;m too old, and so I shan&rsquo;t be capable of seeing much
improvement in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The retort so tickled Joey Ladle that he grunted forth a laugh and
delivered it again, grunting forth another laugh after the second edition
of &ldquo;improvement in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s no laughing matter, Master George,&rdquo;
he resumed, straightening his back once more, &ldquo;is, that young
Master Wilding has gone and changed the luck.&nbsp; Mark my words.&nbsp;
He has changed the luck, and he&rsquo;ll find it out.&nbsp; <i>I</i>
ain&rsquo;t been down here all my life for nothing!&nbsp; <i>I</i> know
by what I notices down here, when it&rsquo;s a-going to rain, when it&rsquo;s
a-going to hold up, when it&rsquo;s a-going to blow, when it&rsquo;s
a-going to be calm.&nbsp; <i>I</i> know, by what I notices down here,
when the luck&rsquo;s changed, quite as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has this growth on the roof anything to do with your divination?&rdquo;
asked Vendale, holding his light towards a gloomy ragged growth of dark
fungus, pendent from the arches with a very disagreeable and repellent
effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are famous for this growth in this vault, aren&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Master George,&rdquo; replied Joey Ladle, moving a
step or two away, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll be advised by me, you&rsquo;ll
let it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking up the rod just now laid across the two casks, and faintly
moving the languid fungus with it, Vendale asked, &ldquo;Ay, indeed?&nbsp;
Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not so much because it rises from the casks of wine,
and may leave you to judge what sort of stuff a Cellarman takes into
himself when he walks in the same all the days of his life, nor yet
so much because at a stage of its growth it&rsquo;s maggots, and you&rsquo;ll
fetch &lsquo;em down upon you,&rdquo; returned Joey Ladle, still keeping
away, &ldquo;as for another reason, Master George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;(I wouldn&rsquo;t keep on touchin&rsquo; it, if I was you,
sir.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you if you&rsquo;ll come out of the place.&nbsp;
First, take a look at its colour, Master George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done, sir.&nbsp; Now, come out of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved away with his light, and Vendale followed with his.&nbsp;
When Vendale came up with him, and they were going back together, Vendale,
eyeing him as they walked through the arches, said: &ldquo;Well, Joey?&nbsp;
The colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it like clotted blood, Master George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than enough, I think,&rdquo; muttered Joey Ladle, shaking
his head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say it is like; say it is exactly like.&nbsp; What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master George, they do say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know who?&rdquo; rejoined the Cellarman, apparently
much exasperated by the unreasonable nature of the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them!&nbsp;
Them as says pretty well everything, you know.&nbsp; How should I know
who They are, if you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&nbsp; Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do say that the man that gets by any accident a piece
of that dark growth right upon his breast, will, for sure and certain,
die by murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Vendale laughingly stopped to meet the Cellarman&rsquo;s eyes,
which he had fastened on his light while dreamily saying those words,
he suddenly became conscious of being struck upon his own breast by
a heavy hand.&nbsp; Instantly following with his eyes the action of
the hand that struck him&mdash;which was his companion&rsquo;s&mdash;he
saw that it had beaten off his breast a web or clot of the fungus even
then floating to the ground.</p>
<p>For a moment he turned upon the Cellarman almost as scared a look
as the Cellarman turned upon him.&nbsp; But in another moment they had
reached the daylight at the foot of the cellar-steps, and before he
cheerfully sprang up them, he blew out his candle and the superstition
together.</p>
<h3>EXIT WILDING</h3>
<p>On the morning of the next day, Wilding went out alone, after leaving
a message with his clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Mr. Vendale should ask for
me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or if Mr. Bintrey should call, tell them
I am gone to the Foundling.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that his partner had said
to him, all that his lawyer, following on the same side, could urge,
had left him persisting unshaken in his own point of view.&nbsp; To
find the lost man, whose place he had usurped, was now the paramount
interest of his life, and to inquire at the Foundling was plainly to
take the first step in the direction of discovery.&nbsp; To the Foundling,
accordingly, the wine-merchant now went.</p>
<p>The once familiar aspect of the building was altered to him, as the
look of the portrait over the chimney-piece was altered to him.&nbsp;
His one dearest association with the place which had sheltered his childhood
had been broken away from it for ever.&nbsp; A strange reluctance possessed
him, when he stated his business at the door.&nbsp; His heart ached
as he sat alone in the waiting-room while the Treasurer of the institution
was being sent for to see him.&nbsp; When the interview began, it was
only by a painful effort that he could compose himself sufficiently
to mention the nature of his errand.</p>
<p>The Treasurer listened with a face which promised all needful attention,
and promised nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are obliged to be cautious,&rdquo; he said, when it came
to his turn to speak, &ldquo;about all inquiries which are made by strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hardly consider me a stranger,&rdquo; answered Wilding,
simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was one of your poor lost children here, in the
bygone time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treasurer politely rejoined that this circumstance inspired him
with a special interest in his visitor.&nbsp; But he pressed, nevertheless
for that visitor&rsquo;s motive in making his inquiry.&nbsp; Without
further preface, Wilding told him his motive, suppressing nothing.&nbsp;
The Treasurer rose, and led the way into the room in which the registers
of the institution were kept.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the information which
our books can give is heartily at your service,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After the time that has elapsed, I am afraid it is the only information
we have to offer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The books were consulted, and the entry was found expressed as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;3d March, 1836.&nbsp; Adopted, and removed from the Foundling
Hospital, a male infant, named Walter Wilding.&nbsp; Name and condition
of the person adopting the child&mdash;Mrs. Jane Ann Miller, widow.&nbsp;
Address&mdash;Lime-Tree Lodge, Groombridge Wells.&nbsp; References&mdash;the
Reverend John Harker, Groombridge Wells; and Messrs. Giles, Jeremie,
and Giles, bankers, Lombard Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked the wine-merchant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had
you no after-communication with Mrs. Miller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None&mdash;or some reference to it must have appeared in this
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I take a copy of the entry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&nbsp; You are a little agitated.&nbsp; Let me make
a copy for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My only chance, I suppose,&rdquo; said Wilding, looking sadly
at the copy, &ldquo;is to inquire at Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s residence,
and to try if her references can help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the only chance I see at present,&rdquo; answered
the Treasurer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heartily wish I could have been of some
further assistance to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With those farewell words to comfort him Wilding set forth on the
journey of investigation which began from the Foundling doors.&nbsp;
The first stage to make for, was plainly the house of business of the
bankers in Lombard Street.&nbsp; Two of the partners in the firm were
inaccessible to chance-visitors when he asked for them.&nbsp; The third,
after raising certain inevitable difficulties, consented to let a clerk
examine the ledger marked with the initial letter &ldquo;M.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The account of Mrs. Miller, widow, of Groombridge Wells, was found.&nbsp;
Two long lines, in faded ink, were drawn across it; and at the bottom
of the page there appeared this note: &ldquo;Account closed, September
30th, 1837.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the first stage of the journey was reached&mdash;and so it ended
in No Thoroughfare!&nbsp; After sending a note to Cripple Corner to
inform his partner that his absence might be prolonged for some hours,
Wilding took his place in the train, and started for the second stage
on the journey&mdash;Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s residence at Groombridge Wells.</p>
<p>Mothers and children travelled with him; mothers and children met
each other at the station; mothers and children were in the shops when
he entered them to inquire for Lime-Tree Lodge.&nbsp; Everywhere, the
nearest and dearest of human relations showed itself happily in the
happy light of day.&nbsp; Everywhere, he was reminded of the treasured
delusion from which he had been awakened so cruelly&mdash;of the lost
memory which had passed from him like a reflection from a glass.</p>
<p>Inquiring here, inquiring there, he could hear of no such place as
Lime-Tree Lodge.&nbsp; Passing a house-agent&rsquo;s office, he went
in wearily, and put the question for the last time.&nbsp; The house-agent
pointed across the street to a dreary mansion of many windows, which
might have been a manufactory, but which was an hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
where Lime-Tree Lodge stood, sir,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;ten years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second stage reached, and No Thoroughfare again!</p>
<p>But one chance was left.&nbsp; The clerical reference, Mr. Harker,
still remained to be found.&nbsp; Customers coming in at the moment
to occupy the house-agent&rsquo;s attention, Wilding went down the street,
and entering a bookseller&rsquo;s shop, asked if he could be informed
of the Reverend John Harker&rsquo;s present address.</p>
<p>The bookseller looked unaffectedly shocked and astonished, and made
no answer.</p>
<p>Wilding repeated his question.</p>
<p>The bookseller took up from his counter a prim little volume in a
binding of sober gray.&nbsp; He handed it to his visitor, open at the
title-page.&nbsp; Wilding read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The martyrdom of the Reverend John Harker in New Zealand.&nbsp;
Related by a former member of his flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilding put the book down on the counter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your
pardon,&rdquo; he said thinking a little, perhaps, of his own present
martyrdom while he spoke.&nbsp; The silent bookseller acknowledged the
apology by a bow.&nbsp; Wilding went out.</p>
<p>Third and last stage, and No Thoroughfare for the third and last
time.</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be done; there was absolutely no choice
but to go back to London, defeated at all points.&nbsp; From time to
time on the return journey, the wine-merchant looked at his copy of
the entry in the Foundling Register.&nbsp; There is one among the many
forms of despair&mdash;perhaps the most pitiable of all&mdash;which
persists in disguising itself as Hope.&nbsp; Wilding checked himself
in the act of throwing the useless morsel of paper out of the carriage
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may lead to something yet,&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;While I live, I won&rsquo;t part with it.&nbsp; When I die, my
executors shall find it sealed up with my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the mention of his will set the good wine-merchant on a new
track of thought, without diverting his mind from its engrossing subject.&nbsp;
He must make his will immediately.</p>
<p>The application of the phrase No Thoroughfare to the case had originated
with Mr. Bintrey.&nbsp; In their first long conference following the
discovery, that sagacious personage had a hundred times repeated, with
an obstructive shake of the head, &ldquo;No Thoroughfare, Sir, No Thoroughfare.&nbsp;
My belief is that there is no way out of this at this time of day, and
my advice is, make yourself comfortable where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of the protracted consultation, a magnum of the forty-five
year old port-wine had been produced for the wetting of Mr. Bintrey&rsquo;s
legal whistle; but the more clearly he saw his way through the wine,
the more emphatically he did not see his way through the case; repeating
as often as he set his glass down empty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Wilding, No
Thoroughfare.&nbsp; Rest and be thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is certain that the honest wine-merchant&rsquo;s anxiety to make
a will originated in profound conscientiousness; though it is possible
(and quite consistent with his rectitude) that he may unconsciously
have derived some feeling of relief from the prospect of delegating
his own difficulty to two other men who were to come after him.&nbsp;
Be that as it may, he pursued his new track of thought with great ardour,
and lost no time in begging George Vendale and Mr. Bintrey to meet him
in Cripple Corner and share his confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being all three assembled with closed doors,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bintrey, addressing the new partner on the occasion, &ldquo;I wish to
observe, before our friend (and my client) entrusts us with his further
views, that I have endorsed what I understand from him to have been
your advice, Mr. Vendale, and what would be the advice of every sensible
man.&nbsp; I have told him that he positively must keep his secret.&nbsp;
I have spoken with Mrs. Goldstraw, both in his presence and in his absence;
and if anybody is to be trusted (which is a very large IF), I think
she is to be trusted to that extent.&nbsp; I have pointed out to our
friend (and my client), that to set on foot random inquiries would not
only be to raise the Devil, in the likeness of all the swindlers in
the kingdom, but would also be to waste the estate.&nbsp; Now, you see,
Mr. Vendale, our friend (and my client) does not desire to waste the
estate, but, on the contrary, desires to husband it for what he considers&mdash;but
I can&rsquo;t say I do&mdash;the rightful owner, if such rightful owner
should ever be found.&nbsp; I am very much mistaken if he ever will
be, but never mind that.&nbsp; Mr. Wilding and I are, at least, agreed
that the estate is not to be wasted.&nbsp; Now, I have yielded to Mr.
Wilding&rsquo;s desire to keep an advertisement at intervals flowing
through the newspapers, cautiously inviting any person who may know
anything about that adopted infant, taken from the Foundling Hospital,
to come to my office; and I have pledged myself that such advertisement
shall regularly appear.&nbsp; I have gathered from our friend (and my
client) that I meet you here to-day to take his instructions, not to
give him advice.&nbsp; I am prepared to receive his instructions, and
to respect his wishes; but you will please observe that this does not
imply my approval of either as a matter of professional opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Bintrey; talking quite is much <i>at</i> Wilding as <i>to</i>
Vendale.&nbsp; And yet, in spite of his care for his client, he was
so amused by his client&rsquo;s Quixotic conduct, as to eye him from
time to time with twinkling eyes, in the light of a highly comical curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; observed Wilding, &ldquo;can be clearer.&nbsp;
I only wish my head were as clear as yours, Mr. Bintrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel that singing in it coming on,&rdquo; hinted the
lawyer, with an alarmed glance, &ldquo;put it off.&mdash;I mean the
interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, I thank you,&rdquo; said Wilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
was I going to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t excite yourself, Mr. Wilding,&rdquo; urged the
lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> going to,&rdquo; said the wine-merchant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Bintrey and George Vendale, would you have any hesitation
or objection to become my joint trustees and executors, or can you at
once consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> consent,&rdquo; replied George Vendale, readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> consent,&rdquo; said Bintrey, not so readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you both.&nbsp; Mr. Bintrey, my instructions for my
last will and testament are short and plain.&nbsp; Perhaps you will
now have the goodness to take them down.&nbsp; I leave the whole of
my real and personal estate, without any exception or reservation whatsoever,
to you two, my joint trustees and executors, in trust to pay over the
whole to the true Walter Wilding, if he shall be found and identified
within two years after the day of my death.&nbsp; Failing that, in trust
to you two to pay over the whole as a benefaction and legacy to the
Foundling Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are all your instructions, are they, Mr. Wilding?&rdquo;
demanded Bintrey, after a blank silence, during which nobody had looked
at anybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to those instructions, you have absolutely made up
your mind, Mr. Wilding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, decidedly, finally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only remains,&rdquo; said the lawyer, with one shrug of
his shoulders, &ldquo;to get them into technical and binding form, and
to execute and attest.&nbsp; Now, does that press?&nbsp; Is there any
hurry about it?&nbsp; You are not going to die yet, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; answered Wilding, gravely, &ldquo;when
I am going to die is within other knowledge than yours or mine.&nbsp;
I shall be glad to have this matter off my mind, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are lawyer and client again,&rdquo; rejoined Bintrey, who,
for the nonce, had become almost sympathetic.&nbsp; &ldquo;If this day
week&mdash;here, at the same hour&mdash;will suit Mr. Vendale and yourself,
I will enter in my Diary that I attend you accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appointment was made, and in due sequence, kept.&nbsp; The will
was formally signed, sealed, delivered, and witnessed, and was carried
off by Mr. Bintrey for safe storage among the papers of his clients,
ranged in their respective iron boxes, with their respective owners&rsquo;
names outside, on iron tiers in his consulting-room, as if that legal
sanctuary were a condensed Family Vault of Clients.</p>
<p>With more heart than he had lately had for former subjects of interest,
Wilding then set about completing his patriarchal establishment, being
much assisted not only by Mrs. Goldstraw but by Vendale too: who, perhaps,
had in his mind the giving of an Obenreizer dinner as soon as possible.&nbsp;
Anyhow, the establishment being reported in sound working order, the
Obenreizers, Guardian and Ward, were asked to dinner, and Madame Dor
was included in the invitation.&nbsp; If Vendale had been over head
and ears in love before&mdash;a phrase not to be taken as implying the
faintest doubt about it&mdash;this dinner plunged him down in love ten
thousand fathoms deep.&nbsp; Yet, for the life of him, he could not
get one word alone with charming Marguerite.&nbsp; So surely as a blessed
moment seemed to come, Obenreizer, in his filmy state, would stand at
Vendale&rsquo;s elbow, or the broad back of Madame Dor would appear
before his eyes.&nbsp; That speechless matron was never seen in a front
view, from the moment of her arrival to that of her departure&mdash;except
at dinner.&nbsp; And from the instant of her retirement to the drawing-room,
after a hearty participation in that meal, she turned her face to the
wall again.</p>
<p>Yet, through four or five delightful though distracting hours, Marguerite
was to be seen, Marguerite was to be heard, Marguerite was to be occasionally
touched.&nbsp; When they made the round of the old dark cellars, Vendale
led her by the hand; when she sang to him in the lighted room at night,
Vendale, standing by her, held her relinquished gloves, and would have
bartered against them every drop of the forty-five year old, though
it had been forty-five times forty-five years old, and its nett price
forty-five times forty-five pounds per dozen.&nbsp; And still, when
she was gone, and a great gap of an extinguisher was clapped on Cripple
Corner, he tormented himself by wondering, Did she think that he admired
her!&nbsp; Did she think that he adored her!&nbsp; Did she suspect that
she had won him, heart and soul!&nbsp; Did she care to think at all
about it!&nbsp; And so, Did she and Didn&rsquo;t she, up and down the
gamut, and above the line and below the line, dear, dear!&nbsp; Poor
restless heart of humanity!&nbsp; To think that the men who were mummies
thousands of years ago, did the same, and ever found the secret how
to be quiet after it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, George,&rdquo; Wilding asked him next day,
&ldquo;of Mr. Obenreizer?&nbsp; (I won&rsquo;t ask you what you think
of Miss Obenreizer.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Vendale, &ldquo;and I never
did know, what to think of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is well informed and clever,&rdquo; said Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good musician.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He had played very well, and
sung very well, overnight.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably a good musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And talks well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said George Vendale, ruminating, &ldquo;and talks
well.&nbsp; Do you know, Wilding, it oddly occurs to me, as I think
about him, that he doesn&rsquo;t keep silence well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&nbsp; He is not obtrusively talkative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t mean that.&nbsp; But when he is silent,
you can hardly help vaguely, though perhaps most unjustly, mistrusting
him.&nbsp; Take people whom you know and like.&nbsp; Take any one you
know and like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon done, my good fellow,&rdquo; said Wilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bargain for that, or foresee it,&rdquo; returned
Vendale, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, take me.&nbsp; Reflect for
a moment.&nbsp; Is your approving knowledge of my interesting face mainly
founded (however various the momentary expressions it may include) on
my face when I am silent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; said Wilding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too.&nbsp; Now, you see, when Obenreizer speaks&mdash;in
other words, when he is allowed to explain himself away&mdash;he comes
out right enough; but when he has not the opportunity of explaining
himself away, he comes out rather wrong.&nbsp; Therefore it is, that
I say he does not keep silence well.&nbsp; And passing hastily in review
such faces as I know, and don&rsquo;t trust, I am inclined to think,
now I give my mind to it, that none of them keep silence well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposition in Physiognomy being new to Wilding, he was at first
slow to admit it, until asking himself the question whether Mrs. Goldstraw
kept silence well, and remembering that her face in repose decidedly
invited trustfulness, he was as glad as men usually are to believe what
they desire to believe.</p>
<p>But, as he was very slow to regain his spirits or his health, his
partner, as another means of setting him up&mdash;and perhaps also with
contingent Obenreizer views&mdash;reminded him of those musical schemes
of his in connection with his family, and how a singing-class was to
be formed in the house, and a Choir in a neighbouring church.&nbsp;
The class was established speedily, and, two or three of the people
having already some musical knowledge, and singing tolerably, the Choir
soon followed.&nbsp; The latter was led, and chiefly taught, by Wilding
himself: who had hopes of converting his dependents into so many Foundlings,
in respect of their capacity to sing sacred choruses.</p>
<p>Now, the Obenreizers being skilled musicians, it was easily brought
to pass that they should be asked to join these musical unions.&nbsp;
Guardian and Ward consenting, or Guardian consenting for both, it was
necessarily brought to pass that Vendale&rsquo;s life became a life
of absolute thraldom and enchantment.&nbsp; For, in the mouldy Christopher-Wren
church on Sundays, with its dearly beloved brethren assembled and met
together, five-and-twenty strong, was not that Her voice that shot like
light into the darkest places, thrilling the walls and pillars as though
they were pieces of his heart!&nbsp; What time, too, Madame Dor in a
corner of the high pew, turning her back upon everybody and everything,
could not fail to be Ritualistically right at some moment of the service;
like the man whom the doctors recommended to get drunk once a month,
and who, that he might not overlook it, got drunk every day.</p>
<p>But, even those seraphic Sundays were surpassed by the Wednesday
concerts established for the patriarchal family.&nbsp; At those concerts
she would sit down to the piano and sing them, in her own tongue, songs
of her own land, songs calling from the mountain-tops to Vendale, &ldquo;Rise
above the grovelling level country; come far away from the crowd; pursue
me as I mount higher; higher, higher, melting into the azure distance;
rise to my supremest height of all, and love me here!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
would the pretty bodice, the clocked stocking, and the silver-buckled
shoe be, like the broad forehead and the bright eyes, fraught with the
spring of a very chamois, until the strain was over.</p>
<p>Not even over Vendale himself did these songs of hers cast a more
potent spell than over Joey Ladle in his different way.&nbsp; Steadily
refusing to muddle the harmony by taking any share in it, and evincing
the supremest contempt for scales and such-like rudiments of music&mdash;which,
indeed, seldom captivate mere listeners&mdash;Joey did at first give
up the whole business for a bad job, and the whole of the performers
for a set of howling Dervishes.&nbsp; But, descrying traces of unmuddled
harmony in a part-song one day, he gave his two under cellarmen faint
hopes of getting on towards something in course of time.&nbsp; An anthem
of Handel&rsquo;s led to further encouragement from him: though he objected
that that great musician must have been down in some of them foreign
cellars pretty much, for to go and say the same thing so many times
over; which, took it in how you might, he considered a certain sign
of your having took it in somehow.&nbsp; On a third occasion, the public
appearance of Mr. Jarvis with a flute, and of an odd man with a violin,
and the performance of a duet by the two, did so astonish him that,
solely of his own impulse and motion, he became inspired with the words,
&ldquo;Ann Koar!&rdquo; repeatedly pronouncing them as if calling in
a familiar manner for some lady who had distinguished herself in the
orchestra.&nbsp; But this was his final testimony to the merits of his
mates, for, the instrumental duet being performed at the first Wednesday
concert, and being presently followed by the voice of Marguerite Obenreizer,
he sat with his mouth wide open, entranced, until she had finished;
when, rising in his place with much solemnity, and prefacing what he
was about to say with a bow that specially included Mr. Wilding in it,
he delivered himself of the gratifying sentiment: &ldquo;Arter that,
ye may all on ye get to bed!&rdquo;&nbsp; And ever afterwards declined
to render homage in any other words to the musical powers of the family.</p>
<p>Thus began a separate personal acquaintance between Marguerite Obenreizer
and Joey Ladle.&nbsp; She laughed so heartily at his compliment, and
yet was so abashed by it, that Joey made bold to say to her, after the
concert was over, he hoped he wasn&rsquo;t so muddled in his head as
to have took a liberty?&nbsp; She made him a gracious reply, and Joey
ducked in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll change the luck time about, Miss,&rdquo; said
Joey, ducking again.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such as you in the place
that can bring round the luck of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&nbsp; Round the luck?&rdquo; she answered, in her pretty
English, and with a pretty wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear I do not understand.&nbsp;
I am so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Master Wilding, Miss,&rdquo; Joey explained confidentially,
though not much to her enlightenment, &ldquo;changed the luck, afore
he took in young Master George.&nbsp; So I say, and so they&rsquo;ll
find.&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; Only come into the place and sing over the luck
a few times, Miss, and it won&rsquo;t be able to help itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, and with a whole brood of ducks, Joey backed out of the
presence.&nbsp; But Joey being a privileged person, and even an involuntary
conquest being pleasant to youth and beauty, Marguerite merrily looked
out for him next time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my Mr. Joey, please?&rdquo; she asked Vendale.</p>
<p>So Joey was produced, and shaken hands with, and that became an Institution.</p>
<p>Another Institution arose in this wise.&nbsp; Joey was a little hard
of hearing.&nbsp; He himself said it was &ldquo;Wapours,&rdquo; and
perhaps it might have been; but whatever the cause of the effect, there
the effect was, upon him.&nbsp; On this first occasion he had been seen
to sidle along the wall, with his left hand to his left ear, until he
had sidled himself into a seat pretty near the singer, in which place
and position he had remained, until addressing to his friends the amateurs
the compliment before mentioned.&nbsp; It was observed on the following
Wednesday that Joey&rsquo;s action as a Pecking Machine was impaired
at dinner, and it was rumoured about the table that this was explainable
by his high-strung expectations of Miss Obenreizer&rsquo;s singing,
and his fears of not getting a place where he could hear every note
and syllable.&nbsp; The rumour reaching Wilding&rsquo;s ears, he in
his good nature called Joey to the front at night before Marguerite
began.&nbsp; Thus the Institution came into being that on succeeding
nights, Marguerite, running her hands over the keys before singing,
always said to Vendale, &ldquo;Where is my Mr. Joey, please?&rdquo;
and that Vendale always brought him forth, and stationed him near by.&nbsp;
That he should then, when all eyes were upon him, express in his face
the utmost contempt for the exertions of his friends and confidence
in Marguerite alone, whom he would stand contemplating, not unlike the
rhinocerous out of the spelling-book, tamed and on his hind legs, was
a part of the Institution.&nbsp; Also that when he remained after the
singing in his most ecstatic state, some bold spirit from the back should
say, &ldquo;What do you think of it, Joey?&rdquo; and he should be goaded
to reply, as having that instant conceived the retort, &ldquo;Arter
that ye may all on ye get to bed!&rdquo;&nbsp; These were other parts
of the Institution.</p>
<p>But, the simple pleasures and small jests of Cripple Corner were
not destined to have a long life.&nbsp; Underlying them from the first
was a serious matter, which every member of the patriarchal family knew
of, but which, by tacit agreement, all forbore to speak of.&nbsp; Mr.
Wilding&rsquo;s health was in a bad way.</p>
<p>He might have overcome the shock he had sustained in the one great
affection of his life, or he might have overcome his consciousness of
being in the enjoyment of another man&rsquo;s property; but the two
together were too much for him.&nbsp; A man haunted by twin ghosts,
he became deeply depressed.&nbsp; The inseparable spectres sat at the
board with him, ate from his platter, drank from his cup, and stood
by his bedside at night.&nbsp; When he recalled his supposed mother&rsquo;s
love, he felt as though he had stolen it.&nbsp; When he rallied a little
under the respect and attachment of his dependants, he felt as though
he were even fraudulent in making them happy, for that should have been
the unknown man&rsquo;s duty and gratification.</p>
<p>Gradually, under the pressure of his brooding mind, his body stooped,
his step lost its elasticity, his eyes were seldom lifted from the ground.&nbsp;
He knew he could not help the deplorable mistake that had been made,
but he knew he could not mend it; for the days and weeks went by, and
no one claimed his name or his possessions.&nbsp; And now there began
to creep over him a cloudy consciousness of often-recurring confusion
in his head.&nbsp; He would unaccountably lose, sometimes whole hours,
sometimes a whole day and night.&nbsp; Once, his remembrance stopped
as he sat at the head of the dinner-table, and was blank until daybreak.&nbsp;
Another time, it stopped as he was beating time to their singing, and
went on again when he and his partner were walking in the court-yard
by the light of the moon, half the night later.&nbsp; He asked Vendale
(always full of consideration, work, and help) how this was?&nbsp; Vendale
only replied, &ldquo;You have not been quite well; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He looked for explanation into the faces of his people.&nbsp; But they
would put it off with &ldquo;Glad to see you looking so much better,
sir;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re doing nicely now, sir;&rdquo;
in which was no information at all.</p>
<p>At length, when the partnership was but five months old, Walter Wilding
took to his bed, and his housekeeper became his nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lying here, perhaps you will not mind my calling you Sally,
Mrs. Goldstraw?&rdquo; said the poor wine-merchant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds more natural to me, sir, than any other name, and
I like it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sally.&nbsp; I think, Sally, I must of late have
been subject to fits.&nbsp; Is that so, Sally?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind
telling me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has happened, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; That is the explanation!&rdquo; he quietly remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Obenreizer, Sally, talks of the world being so small that
it is not strange how often the same people come together, and come
together at various places, and in various stages of life.&nbsp; But
it does seem strange, Sally, that I should, as I may say, come round
to the Foundling to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended his hand to her, and she gently took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going to die, dear Mr. Wilding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Bintrey said, but I think he was wrong.&nbsp; The old
child-feeling is coming back upon me, Sally.&nbsp; The old hush and
rest, as I used to fall asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an interval he said, in a placid voice, &ldquo;Please kiss
me, Nurse,&rdquo; and, it was evident, believed himself to be lying
in the old Dormitory.</p>
<p>As she had been used to bend over the fatherless and motherless children,
Sally bent over the fatherless and motherless man, and put her lips
to his forehead, murmuring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; he replied, in the same tone.</p>
<p>After another interval, he opened his eyes in his own character,
and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move me, Sally, because of what I am going
to say; I lie quite easily.&nbsp; I think my time is come, I don&rsquo;t
know how it may appear to you, Sally, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Insensibility fell upon him for a few minutes; he emerged from it
once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how it may appear to you, Sally,
but so it appears to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had thus conscientiously finished his favourite sentence,
his time came, and he died.</p>
<h2>ACT II.</h2>
<h3>VENDALE MAKES LOVE</h3>
<p>The summer and the autumn passed.&nbsp; Christmas and the New Year
were at hand.</p>
<p>As executors honestly bent on performing their duty towards the dead,
Vendale and Bintrey had held more than one anxious consultation on the
subject of Wilding&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; The lawyer had declared, from
the first, that it was simply impossible to take any useful action in
the matter at all.&nbsp; The only obvious inquiries to make, in relation
to the lost man, had been made already by Wilding himself; with this
result, that time and death together had not left a trace of him discoverable.&nbsp;
To advertise for the claimant to the property, it would be necessary
to mention particulars&mdash;a course of proceeding which would invite
half the impostors in England to present themselves in the character
of the true Walter Wilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we find a chance of tracing
the lost man, we will take it.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t, let us meet
for another consultation on the first anniversary of Wilding&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Bintrey advised.&nbsp; And so, with the most
earnest desire to fulfil his dead friend&rsquo;s wishes, Vendale was
fain to let the matter rest for the present.</p>
<p>Turning from his interest in the past to his interest in the future,
Vendale still found himself confronting a doubtful prospect.&nbsp; Months
on months had passed since his first visit to Soho Square&mdash;and
through all that time, the one language in which he had told Marguerite
that he loved her was the language of the eyes, assisted, at convenient
opportunities, by the language of the hand.</p>
<p>What was the obstacle in his way?&nbsp; The one immovable obstacle
which had been in his way from the first.&nbsp; No matter how fairly
the opportunities looked, Vendale&rsquo;s efforts to speak with Marguerite
alone ended invariably in one and the same result.&nbsp; Under the most
accidental circumstances, in the most innocent manner possible, Obenreizer
was always in the way.</p>
<p>With the last days of the old year came an unexpected chance of spending
an evening with Marguerite, which Vendale resolved should be a chance
of speaking privately to her as well.&nbsp; A cordial note from Obenreizer
invited him, on New Year&rsquo;s Day, to a little family dinner in Soho
Square.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall be only four,&rdquo; the note said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We shall be only two,&rdquo; Vendale determined, &ldquo;before
the evening is out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s Day, among the English, is associated with the giving
and receiving of dinners, and with nothing more.&nbsp; New Year&rsquo;s
Day, among the foreigners, is the grand opportunity of the year for
the giving and receiving of presents.&nbsp; It is occasionally possible
to acclimatise a foreign custom.&nbsp; In this instance Vendale felt
no hesitation about making the attempt.&nbsp; His one difficulty was
to decide what his New Year&rsquo;s gift to Marguerite should be.&nbsp;
The defensive pride of the peasant&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;morbidly sensitive
to the inequality between her social position and his&mdash;would be
secretly roused against him if he ventured on a rich offering.&nbsp;
A gift, which a poor man&rsquo;s purse might purchase, was the one gift
that could be trusted to find its way to her heart, for the giver&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Stoutly resisting temptation, in the form of diamonds and
rubies, Vendale bought a brooch of the filagree-work of Genoa&mdash;the
simplest and most unpretending ornament that he could find in the jeweller&rsquo;s
shop.</p>
<p>He slipped his gift into Marguerite&rsquo;s hand as she held it out
to welcome him on the day of the dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your first New Year&rsquo;s Day in England,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you let me help to make it like a New Year&rsquo;s
Day at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thanked him, a little constrainedly, as she looked at the jeweller&rsquo;s
box, uncertain what it might contain.&nbsp; Opening the box, and discovering
the studiously simple form under which Vendale&rsquo;s little keepsake
offered itself to her, she penetrated his motive on the spot.&nbsp;
Her face turned on him brightly, with a look which said, &ldquo;I own
you have pleased and flattered me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never had she been so
charming, in Vendale&rsquo;s eyes, as she was at that moment.&nbsp;
Her winter dress&mdash;a petticoat of dark silk, with a bodice of black
velvet rising to her neck, and enclosing it softly in a little circle
of swansdown&mdash;heightened, by all the force of contrast, the dazzling
fairness of her hair and her complexion.&nbsp; It was only when she
turned aside from him to the glass, and, taking out the brooch that
she wore, put his New Year&rsquo;s gift in its place, that Vendale&rsquo;s
attention wandered far enough away from her to discover the presence
of other persons in the room.&nbsp; He now became conscious that the
hands of Obenreizer were affectionately in possession of his elbows.&nbsp;
He now heard the voice of Obenreizer thanking him for his attention
to Marguerite, with the faintest possible ring of mockery in its tone.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Such a simple present, dear sir! and showing such nice tact!&rdquo;)&nbsp;
He now discovered, for the first time, that there was one other guest,
and but one, besides himself, whom Obenreizer presented as a compatriot
and friend.&nbsp; The friend&rsquo;s face was mouldy, and the friend&rsquo;s
figure was fat.&nbsp; His age was suggestive of the autumnal period
of human life.&nbsp; In the course of the evening he developed two extraordinary
capacities.&nbsp; One was a capacity for silence; the other was a capacity
for emptying bottles.</p>
<p>Madame Dor was not in the room.&nbsp; Neither was there any visible
place reserved for her when they sat down to table.&nbsp; Obenreizer
explained that it was &ldquo;the good Dor&rsquo;s simple habit to dine
always in the middle of the day.&nbsp; She would make her excuses later
in the evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vendale wondered whether the good Dor had,
on this occasion, varied her domestic employment from cleaning Obenreizer&rsquo;s
gloves to cooking Obenreizer&rsquo;s dinner.&nbsp; This at least was
certain&mdash;the dishes served were, one and all, as achievements in
cookery, high above the reach of the rude elementary art of England.&nbsp;
The dinner was unobtrusively perfect.&nbsp; As for the wine, the eyes
of the speechless friend rolled over it, as in solemn ecstasy.&nbsp;
Sometimes he said &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; when a bottle came in full; and
sometimes he said &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; when a bottle went out empty&mdash;and
there his contributions to the gaiety of the evening ended.</p>
<p>Silence is occasionally infectious.&nbsp; Oppressed by private anxieties
of their own, Marguerite and Vendale appeared to feel the influence
of the speechless friend.&nbsp; The whole responsibility of keeping
the talk going rested on Obenreizer&rsquo;s shoulders, and manfully
did Obenreizer sustain it.&nbsp; He opened his heart in the character
of an enlightened foreigner, and sang the praises of England.&nbsp;
When other topics ran dry, he returned to this inexhaustible source,
and always set the stream running again as copiously as ever.&nbsp;
Obenreizer would have given an arm, an eye, or a leg to have been born
an Englishman.&nbsp; Out of England there was no such institution as
a home, no such thing as a fireside, no such object as a beautiful woman.&nbsp;
His dear Miss Marguerite would excuse him, if he accounted for <i>her</i>
attractions on the theory that English blood must have mixed at some
former time with their obscure and unknown ancestry.&nbsp; Survey this
English nation, and behold a tall, clean, plump, and solid people!&nbsp;
Look at their cities!&nbsp; What magnificence in their public buildings!&nbsp;
What admirable order and propriety in their streets!&nbsp; Admire their
laws, combining the eternal principle of justice with the other eternal
principle of pounds, shillings, and pence; and applying the product
to all civil injuries, from an injury to a man&rsquo;s honour, to an
injury to a man&rsquo;s nose!&nbsp; You have ruined my daughter&mdash;pounds,
shillings, and pence!&nbsp; You have knocked me down with a blow in
my face&mdash;pounds, shillings, and pence!&nbsp; Where was the material
prosperity of such a country as <i>that</i> to stop?&nbsp; Obenreizer,
projecting himself into the future, failed to see the end of it.&nbsp;
Obenreizer&rsquo;s enthusiasm entreated permission to exhale itself,
English fashion, in a toast.&nbsp; Here is our modest little dinner
over, here is our frugal dessert on the table, and here is the admirer
of England conforming to national customs, and making a speech!&nbsp;
A toast to your white cliffs of Albion, Mr. Vendale! to your national
virtues, your charming climate, and your fascinating women! to your
Hearths, to your Homes, to your Habeas Corpus, and to all your other
institutions!&nbsp; In one word&mdash;to England!&nbsp; Heep-heep-heep!
hooray!</p>
<p>Obenreizer&rsquo;s voice had barely chanted the last note of the
English cheer, the speechless friend had barely drained the last drop
out of his glass, when the festive proceedings were interrupted by a
modest tap at the door.&nbsp; A woman-servant came in, and approached
her master with a little note in her hand.&nbsp; Obenreizer opened the
note with a frown; and, after reading it with an expression of genuine
annoyance, passed it on to his compatriot and friend.&nbsp; Vendale&rsquo;s
spirits rose as he watched these proceedings.&nbsp; Had he found an
ally in the annoying little note?&nbsp; Was the long-looked-for chance
actually coming at last?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there is no help for it?&rdquo; said Obenreizer,
addressing his fellow-countryman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid we must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speechless friend handed back the letter, shrugged his heavy
shoulders, and poured himself out a last glass of wine.&nbsp; His fat
fingers lingered fondly round the neck of the bottle.&nbsp; They pressed
it with a little amatory squeeze at parting.&nbsp; His globular eyes
looked dimly, as through an intervening haze, at Vendale and Marguerite.&nbsp;
His heavy articulation laboured, and brought forth a whole sentence
at a birth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should have
liked a little more wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; His breath failed him after that
effort; he gasped, and walked to the door.</p>
<p>Obenreizer addressed himself to Vendale with an appearance of the
deepest distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so shocked, so confused, so distressed,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A misfortune has happened to one of my compatriots.&nbsp; He
is alone, he is ignorant of your language&mdash;I and my good friend,
here, have no choice but to go and help him.&nbsp; What can I say in
my excuse?&nbsp; How can I describe my affliction at depriving myself
in this way of the honour of your company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, evidently expecting to see Vendale take up his hat and
retire.&nbsp; Discerning his opportunity at last, Vendale determined
to do nothing of the kind.&nbsp; He met Obenreizer dexterously, with
Obenreizer&rsquo;s own weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t distress yourself,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here with the greatest pleasure till you come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marguerite blushed deeply, and turned away to her embroidery-frame
in a corner by the window.&nbsp; The film showed itself in Obenreizer&rsquo;s
eyes, and the smile came something sourly to Obenreizer&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;
To have told Vendale that there was no reasonable prospect of his coming
back in good time, would have been to risk offending a man whose favourable
opinion was of solid commercial importance to him.&nbsp; Accepting his
defeat with the best possible grace, he declared himself to be equally
honoured and delighted by Vendale&rsquo;s proposal.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
frank, so friendly, so English!&rdquo;&nbsp; He bustled about, apparently
looking for something he wanted, disappeared for a moment through the
folding-doors communicating with the next room, came back with his hat
and coat, and protesting that he would return at the earliest possible
moment, embraced Vendale&rsquo;s elbows, and vanished from the scene
in company with the speechless friend.</p>
<p>Vendale turned to the corner by the window, in which Marguerite had
placed herself with her work.&nbsp; There, as if she had dropped from
the ceiling, or come up through the floor&mdash;there, in the old attitude,
with her face to the stove&mdash;sat an Obstacle that had not been foreseen,
in the person of Madame Dor!&nbsp; She half got up, half looked over
her broad shoulder at Vendale, and plumped down again.&nbsp; Was she
at work?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Cleaning Obenreizer&rsquo;s gloves, as before?&nbsp;
No; darning Obenreizer&rsquo;s stockings.</p>
<p>The case was now desperate.&nbsp; Two serious considerations presented
themselves to Vendale.&nbsp; Was it possible to put Madame Dor into
the stove?&nbsp; The stove wouldn&rsquo;t hold her.&nbsp; Was it possible
to treat Madame Dor, not as a living woman, but as an article of furniture?&nbsp;
Could the mind be brought to contemplate this respectable matron purely
in the light of a chest of drawers, with a black gauze held-dress accidentally
left on the top of it?&nbsp; Yes, the mind could be brought to do that.&nbsp;
With a comparatively trifling effort, Vendale&rsquo;s mind did it.&nbsp;
As he took his place on the old-fashioned window-seat, close by Marguerite
and her embroidery, a slight movement appeared in the chest of drawers,
but no remark issued from it.&nbsp; Let it be remembered that solid
furniture is not easy to move, and that it has this advantage in consequence&mdash;there
is no fear of upsetting it.</p>
<p>Unusually silent and unusually constrained&mdash;with the bright
colour fast fading from her face, with a feverish energy possessing
her fingers&mdash;the pretty Marguerite bent over her embroidery, and
worked as if her life depended on it.&nbsp; Hardly less agitated himself,
Vendale felt the importance of leading her very gently to the avowal
which he was eager to make&mdash;to the other sweeter avowal still,
which he was longing to hear.&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s love is never to
be taken by storm; it yields insensibly to a system of gradual approach.&nbsp;
It ventures by the roundabout way, and listens to the low voice.&nbsp;
Vendale led her memory back to their past meetings when they were travelling
together in Switzerland.&nbsp; They revived the impressions, they recalled
the events, of the happy bygone time.&nbsp; Little by little, Marguerite&rsquo;s
constraint vanished.&nbsp; She smiled, she was interested, she looked
at Vendale, she grew idle with her needle, she made false stitches in
her work.&nbsp; Their voices sank lower and lower; their faces bent
nearer and nearer to each other as they spoke.&nbsp; And Madame Dor?&nbsp;
Madame Dor behaved like an angel.&nbsp; She never looked round; she
never said a word; she went on with Obenreizer&rsquo;s stockings.&nbsp;
Pulling each stocking up tight over her left arm, and holding that arm
aloft from time to time, to catch the light on her work, there were
moments&mdash;delicate and indescribable moments&mdash;when Madame Dor
appeared to be sitting upside down, and contemplating one of her own
respectable legs, elevated in the air.&nbsp; As the minutes wore on,
these elevations followed each other at longer and longer intervals.&nbsp;
Now and again, the black gauze head-dress nodded, dropped forward, recovered
itself.&nbsp; A little heap of stockings slid softly from Madame Dor&rsquo;s
lap, and remained unnoticed on the floor.&nbsp; A prodigious ball of
worsted followed the stockings, and rolled lazily under the table.&nbsp;
The black gauze head-dress nodded, dropped forward, recovered itself,
nodded again, dropped forward again, and recovered itself no more.&nbsp;
A composite sound, partly as of the purring of an immense cat, partly
as of the planing of a soft board, rose over the hushed voices of the
lovers, and hummed at regular intervals through the room.&nbsp; Nature
and Madame Dor had combined together in Vendale&rsquo;s interests.&nbsp;
The best of women was asleep.</p>
<p>Marguerite rose to stop&mdash;not the snoring&mdash;let us say, the
audible repose of Madame Dor.&nbsp; Vendale laid his hand on her arm,
and pressed her back gently into her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb her,&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have been waiting to tell you a secret.&nbsp; Let me tell it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marguerite resumed her seat.&nbsp; She tried to resume her needle.&nbsp;
It was useless; her eyes failed her; her hand failed her; she could
find nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been talking,&rdquo; said Vendale, &ldquo;of the happy
time when we first met, and first travelled together.&nbsp; I have a
confession to make.&nbsp; I have been concealing something.&nbsp; When
we spoke of my first visit to Switzerland, I told you of all the impressions
I had brought back with me to England&mdash;except one.&nbsp; Can you
guess what that one is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes looked stedfastly at the embroidery, and her face turned
a little away from him.&nbsp; Signs of disturbance began to appear in
her neat velvet bodice, round the region of the brooch.&nbsp; She made
no reply.&nbsp; Vendale pressed the question without mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you guess what the one Swiss impression is which I have
not told you yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face turned back towards him, and a faint smile trembled on her
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An impression of the mountains, perhaps?&rdquo; she said slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; a much more precious impression than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the lakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; The lakes have not grown dearer and dearer in remembrance
to me every day.&nbsp; The lakes are not associated with my happiness
in the present, and my hopes in the future.&nbsp; Marguerite! all that
makes life worth having hangs, for me, on a word from your lips.&nbsp;
Marguerite!&nbsp; I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head drooped as he took her hand.&nbsp; He drew her to him, and
looked at her.&nbsp; The tears escaped from her downcast eyes, and fell
slowly over her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Vendale,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;it would have
been kinder to have kept your secret.&nbsp; Have you forgotten the distance
between us?&nbsp; It can never, never be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be but one distance between us, Marguerite&mdash;a
distance of your making.&nbsp; My love, my darling, there is no higher
rank in goodness, there is no higher rank in beauty, than yours!&nbsp;
Come! whisper the one little word which tells me you will be my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think of your family,&rdquo; she
murmured; &ldquo;and think of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale drew her a little nearer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dwell on such an obstacle as that,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I shall think but one thought&mdash;I shall think I have offended
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started, and looked up.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed
innocently.&nbsp; The instant the words passed her lips, she saw the
construction that might be placed on them.&nbsp; Her confession had
escaped her in spite of herself.&nbsp; A lovely flush of colour overspread
her face.&nbsp; She made a momentary effort to disengage herself from
her lover&rsquo;s embrace.&nbsp; She looked up at him entreatingly.&nbsp;
She tried to speak.&nbsp; The words died on her lips in the kiss that
Vendale pressed on them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me go, Mr. Vendale!&rdquo;
she said faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her head on his bosom.&nbsp; All her heart went out to him
at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;George!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say you love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her arms twined themselves gently round his neck.&nbsp; Her lips,
timidly touching his cheek, murmured the delicious words&mdash;&ldquo;I
love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the moment of silence that followed, the sound of the opening
and closing of the house-door came clear to them through the wintry
stillness of the street.</p>
<p>Marguerite started to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried from the room, and touched Madame Dor&rsquo;s shoulder
in passing.&nbsp; Madame Dor woke up with a loud snort, looked first
over one shoulder and then over the other, peered down into her lap,
and discovered neither stockings, worsted, nor darning-needle in it.&nbsp;
At the same moment, footsteps became audible ascending the stairs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; said Madame Dor, addressing herself to the stove,
and trembling violently.&nbsp; Vendale picked up the stockings and the
ball, and huddled them all back in a heap over her shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mon
Dieu!&rdquo; said Madame Dor, for the second time, as the avalanche
of worsted poured into her capacious lap.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Obenreizer came in.&nbsp; His first glance round
the room showed him that Marguerite was absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;my niece is away?&nbsp;
My niece is not here to entertain you in my absence?&nbsp; This is unpardonable.&nbsp;
I shall bring her back instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you will not disturb Miss Obenreizer,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have returned, I see, without your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend remains, and consoles our afflicted compatriot.&nbsp;
A heart-rending scene, Mr. Vendale!&nbsp; The household gods at the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s&mdash;the family immersed in tears.&nbsp; We all
embraced in silence.&nbsp; My admirable friend alone possessed his composure.&nbsp;
He sent out, on the spot, for a bottle of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I say a word to you in private, Mr. Obenreizer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to Madame Dor.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
good creature, you are sinking for want of repose.&nbsp; Mr. Vendale
will excuse you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Dor rose, and set forth sideways on her journey from the stove
to bed.&nbsp; She dropped a stocking.&nbsp; Vendale picked it up for
her, and opened one of the folding-doors.&nbsp; She advanced a step,
and dropped three more stockings.&nbsp; Vendale stooping to recover
them as before, Obenreizer interfered with profuse apologies, and with
a warning look at Madame Dor.&nbsp; Madame Dor acknowledged the look
by dropping the whole of the stockings in a heap, and then shuffling
away panic-stricken from the scene of disaster.&nbsp; Obenreizer swept
up the complete collection fiercely in both hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;
he cried, giving his prodigious handful a preparatory swing in the air.&nbsp;
Madame Dor said, &ldquo;Mon Dieu,&rdquo; and vanished into the next
room, pursued by a shower of stockings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must you think, Mr. Vendale,&rdquo; said Obenreizer,
closing the door, &ldquo;of this deplorable intrusion of domestic details?&nbsp;
For myself, I blush at it.&nbsp; We are beginning the New Year as badly
as possible; everything has gone wrong to-night.&nbsp; Be seated, pray&mdash;and
say, what may I offer you?&nbsp; Shall we pay our best respects to another
of your noble English institutions?&nbsp; It is my study to be, what
you call, jolly.&nbsp; I propose a grog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale declined the grog with all needful respect for that noble
institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak to you on a subject in which I am deeply interested,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have observed, Mr. Obenreizer, that I
have, from the first, felt no ordinary admiration for your charming
niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good.&nbsp; In my niece&rsquo;s name, I thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you may have noticed, latterly, that my admiration
for Miss Obenreizer has grown into a tenderer and deeper feeling&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we say friendship, Mr. Vendale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say love&mdash;and we shall be nearer to the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer started out of his chair.&nbsp; The faintly discernible
beat, which was his nearest approach to a change of colour, showed itself
suddenly in his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Miss Obenreizer&rsquo;s guardian,&rdquo; pursued Vendale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ask you to confer upon me the greatest of all favours&mdash;I
ask you to give me her hand in marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer dropped back into his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Vendale,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you petrify me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; rejoined Vendale, &ldquo;until you have
recovered yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word before I recover myself.&nbsp; You have said nothing
about this to my niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have opened my whole heart to your niece.&nbsp; And I have
reason to hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; interposed Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
made a proposal to my niece, without first asking for my authority to
pay your addresses to her?&rdquo;&nbsp; He struck his hand on the table,
and lost his hold over himself for the first time in Vendale&rsquo;s
experience of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed, indignantly,
&ldquo;what sort of conduct is this?&nbsp; As a man of honour, speaking
to a man of honour, how can you justify it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only justify it as one of our English institutions,&rdquo;
said Vendale quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You admire our English institutions.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t honestly tell you, Mr. Obenreizer, that I regret what
I have done.&nbsp; I can only assure you that I have not acted in the
matter with any intentional disrespect towards yourself.&nbsp; This
said, may I ask you to tell me plainly what objection you see to favouring
my suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see this immense objection,&rdquo; answered Obenreizer,
&ldquo;that my niece and you are not on a social equality together.&nbsp;
My niece is the daughter of a poor peasant; and you are the son of a
gentleman.&nbsp; You do us an honour,&rdquo; he added, lowering himself
again gradually to his customary polite level, &ldquo;which deserves,
and has, our most grateful acknowledgments.&nbsp; But the inequality
is too glaring; the sacrifice is too great.&nbsp; You English are a
proud people, Mr. Vendale.&nbsp; I have observed enough of this country
to see that such a marriage as you propose would be a scandal here.&nbsp;
Not a hand would be held out to your peasant-wife; and all your best
friends would desert you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Vendale, interposing on his side.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I may claim, without any great arrogance, to know more of my
country people in general, and of my own friends in particular, than
you do.&nbsp; In the estimation of everybody whose opinion is worth
having, my wife herself would be the one sufficient justification of
my marriage.&nbsp; If I did not feel certain&mdash;observe, I say certain&mdash;that
I am offering her a position which she can accept without so much as
the shadow of a humiliation&mdash;I would never (cost me what it might)
have asked her to be my wife.&nbsp; Is there any other obstacle that
you see?&nbsp; Have you any personal objection to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer spread out both his hands in courteous protest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Personal objection!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear sir,
the bare question is painful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are both men of business,&rdquo; pursued Vendale, &ldquo;and
you naturally expect me to satisfy you that I have the means of supporting
a wife.&nbsp; I can explain my pecuniary position in two words.&nbsp;
I inherit from my parents a fortune of twenty thousand pounds.&nbsp;
In half of that sum I have only a life-interest, to which, if I die,
leaving a widow, my widow succeeds.&nbsp; If I die, leaving children,
the money itself is divided among them, as they come of age.&nbsp; The
other half of my fortune is at my own disposal, and is invested in the
wine-business.&nbsp; I see my way to greatly improving that business.&nbsp;
As it stands at present, I cannot state my return from my capital embarked
at more than twelve hundred a year.&nbsp; Add the yearly value of my
life-interest&mdash;and the total reaches a present annual income of
fifteen hundred pounds.&nbsp; I have the fairest prospect of soon making
it more.&nbsp; In the meantime, do you object to me on pecuniary grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driven back to his last entrenchment, Obenreizer rose, and took a
turn backwards and forwards in the room.&nbsp; For the moment, he was
plainly at a loss what to say or do next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I answer that last question,&rdquo; he said, after
a little close consideration with himself, &ldquo;I beg leave to revert
for a moment to Miss Marguerite.&nbsp; You said something just now which
seemed to imply that she returns the sentiment with which you are pleased
to regard her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the inestimable happiness,&rdquo; said Vendale, &ldquo;of
knowing that she loves me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer stood silent for a moment, with the film over his eyes,
and the faintly perceptible beat becoming visible again in his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me for a few minutes,&rdquo; he said, with
ceremonious politeness, &ldquo;I should like to have the opportunity
of speaking to my niece.&rdquo;&nbsp; With those words, he bowed, and
quitted the room.</p>
<p>Left by himself, Vendale&rsquo;s thoughts (as a necessary result
of the interview, thus far) turned instinctively to the consideration
of Obenreizer&rsquo;s motives.&nbsp; He had put obstacles in the way
of the courtship; he was now putting obstacles in the way of the marriage&mdash;a
marriage offering advantages which even his ingenuity could not dispute.&nbsp;
On the face of it, his conduct was incomprehensible.&nbsp; What did
it mean?</p>
<p>Seeking, under the surface, for the answer to that question&mdash;and
remembering that Obenreizer was a man of about his own age; also, that
Marguerite was, strictly speaking, his half-niece only&mdash;Vendale
asked himself, with a lover&rsquo;s ready jealousy, whether he had a
rival to fear, as well as a guardian to conciliate.&nbsp; The thought
just crossed his mind, and no more.&nbsp; The sense of Marguerite&rsquo;s
kiss still lingering on his cheek reminded him gently that even the
jealousy of a moment was now a treason to <i>her</i>.</p>
<p>On reflection, it seemed most likely that a personal motive of another
kind might suggest the true explanation of Obenreizer&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp;
Marguerite&rsquo;s grace and beauty were precious ornaments in that
little household.&nbsp; They gave it a special social attraction and
a special social importance.&nbsp; They armed Obenreizer with a certain
influence in reserve, which he could always depend upon to make his
house attractive, and which he might always bring more or less to bear
on the forwarding of his own private ends.&nbsp; Was he the sort of
man to resign such advantages as were here implied, without obtaining
the fullest possible compensation for the loss?&nbsp; A connection by
marriage with Vendale offered him solid advantages, beyond all doubt.&nbsp;
But there were hundreds of men in London with far greater power and
far wider influence than Vendale possessed.&nbsp; Was it possible that
this man&rsquo;s ambition secretly looked higher than the highest prospects
that could be offered to him by the alliance now proposed for his niece?&nbsp;
As the question passed through Vendale&rsquo;s mind, the man himself
reappeared&mdash;to answer it, or not to answer it, as the event might
prove.</p>
<p>A marked change was visible in Obenreizer when he resumed his place.&nbsp;
His manner was less assured, and there were plain traces about his mouth
of recent agitation which had not been successfully composed.&nbsp;
Had he said something, referring either to Vendale or to himself, which
had raised Marguerite&rsquo;s spirit, and which had placed him, for
the first time, face to face with a resolute assertion of his niece&rsquo;s
will?&nbsp; It might or might not be.&nbsp; This only was certain&mdash;he
looked like a man who had met with a repulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to my niece,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
find, Mr. Vendale, that even your influence has not entirely blinded
her to the social objections to your proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; returned Vendale, &ldquo;if that is the
only result of your interview with Miss Obenreizer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A momentary flash leapt out through the Obenreizer film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are master of the situation,&rdquo; he answered, in a
tone of sardonic submission.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you insist on my admitting
it, I do admit it in those words.&nbsp; My niece&rsquo;s will and mine
used to be one, Mr. Vendale.&nbsp; You have come between us, and her
will is now yours.&nbsp; In my country, we know when we are beaten,
and we submit with our best grace.&nbsp; I submit, with my best grace,
on certain conditions.&nbsp; Let us revert to the statement of your
pecuniary position.&nbsp; I have an objection to you, my dear sir&mdash;a
most amazing, a most audacious objection, from a man in my position
to a man in yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have honoured me by making a proposal for my niece&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; For the present (with best thanks and respects), I beg to
decline it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are not rich enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The objection, as the speaker had foreseen, took Vendale completely
by surprise.&nbsp; For the moment he was speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your income is fifteen hundred a year,&rdquo; pursued Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In my miserable country I should fall on my knees before your
income, and say, &lsquo;What a princely fortune!&rsquo;&nbsp; In wealthy
England, I sit as I am, and say, &lsquo;A modest independence, dear
sir; nothing more.&nbsp; Enough, perhaps, for a wife in your own rank
of life who has no social prejudices to conquer.&nbsp; Not more than
half enough for a wife who is a meanly born foreigner, and who has all
your social prejudices against her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir! if my niece is
ever to marry you, she will have what you call uphill work of it in
taking her place at starting.&nbsp; Yes, yes; this is not your view,
but it remains, immovably remains, my view for all that.&nbsp; For my
niece&rsquo;s sake, I claim that this uphill work shall be made as smooth
as possible.&nbsp; Whatever material advantages she can have to help
her, ought, in common justice, to be hers.&nbsp; Now, tell me, Mr. Vendale,
on your fifteen hundred a year can your wife have a house in a fashionable
quarter, a footman to open her door, a butler to wait at her table,
and a carriage and horses to drive about in?&nbsp; I see the answer
in your face&mdash;your face says, No.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; Tell me
one more thing, and I have done.&nbsp; Take the mass of your educated,
accomplished, and lovely country-women, is it, or is it not, the fact
that a lady who has a house in a fashionable quarter, a footman to open
her door, a butler to wait at her table, and a carriage and horses to
drive about in, is a lady who has gained four steps, in female estimation,
at starting?&nbsp; Yes? or No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the point,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;You view
this question as a question of terms.&nbsp; What are your terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lowest terms, dear sir, on which you can provide your
wife with those four steps at starting.&nbsp; Double your present income&mdash;the
most rigid economy cannot do it in England on less.&nbsp; You said just
now that you expected greatly to increase the value of your business.&nbsp;
To work&mdash;and increase it!&nbsp; I am a good devil after all!&nbsp;
On the day when you satisfy me, by plain proofs, that your income has
risen to three thousand a year, ask me for my niece&rsquo;s hand, and
it is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire if you have mentioned this arrangement to Miss
Obenreizer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; She has a last little morsel of regard still
left for me, Mr. Vendale, which is not yours yet; and she accepts my
terms.&nbsp; In other words, she submits to be guided by her guardian&rsquo;s
regard for her welfare, and by her guardian&rsquo;s superior knowledge
of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He threw himself back in his chair, in firm
reliance on his position, and in full possession of his excellent temper.</p>
<p>Any open assertion of his own interests, in the situation in which
Vendale was now placed, seemed to be (for the present at least) hopeless.&nbsp;
He found himself literally left with no ground to stand on.&nbsp; Whether
Obenreizer&rsquo;s objections were the genuine product of Obenreizer&rsquo;s
own view of the case, or whether he was simply delaying the marriage
in the hope of ultimately breaking it off altogether&mdash;in either
of these events, any present resistance on Vendale&rsquo;s part would
be equally useless.&nbsp; There was no help for it but to yield, making
the best terms that he could on his own side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest against the conditions you impose on me,&rdquo;
he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Obenreizer; &ldquo;I dare say I should
protest, myself, in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, however,&rdquo; pursued Vendale, &ldquo;that I accept
your terms.&nbsp; In that case, I must be permitted to make two stipulations
on my part.&nbsp; In the first place, I shall expect to be allowed to
see your niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! to see my niece? and to make her in as great a hurry
to be married as you are yourself?&nbsp; Suppose I say, No? you would
see her perhaps without my permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightfully frank!&nbsp; How exquisitely English!&nbsp;
You shall see her, Mr. Vendale, on certain days, which we will appoint
together.&nbsp; What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your objection to my income,&rdquo; proceeded Vendale, &ldquo;has
taken me completely by surprise.&nbsp; I wish to be assured against
any repetition of that surprise.&nbsp; Your present views of my qualification
for marriage require me to have an income of three thousand a year.&nbsp;
Can I be certain, in the future, as your experience of England enlarges,
that your estimate will rise no higher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In plain English,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, &ldquo;you doubt
my word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you purpose to take <i>my</i> word for it when I inform
you that I have doubled my income?&rdquo; asked Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
my memory does not deceive me, you stipulated, a minute since, for plain
proofs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well played, Mr. Vendale!&nbsp; You combine the foreign quickness
with the English solidity.&nbsp; Accept my best congratulations.&nbsp;
Accept, also, my written guarantee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose; seated himself at a writing-desk at a side-table, wrote
a few lines, and presented them to Vendale with a low bow.&nbsp; The
engagement was perfectly explicit, and was signed and dated with scrupulous
care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied with your guarantee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charmed to hear it, I am sure.&nbsp; We have had our little
skirmish&mdash;we have really been wonderfully clever on both sides.&nbsp;
For the present our affairs are settled.&nbsp; I bear no malice.&nbsp;
You bear no malice.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Vendale, a good English shake hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale gave his hand, a little bewildered by Obenreizer&rsquo;s
sudden transitions from one humour to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When may I expect to see Miss Obenreizer again?&rdquo; he
asked, as he rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour me with a visit to-morrow,&rdquo; said Obenreizer,
&ldquo;and we will settle it then.&nbsp; Do have a grog before you go!&nbsp;
No?&nbsp; Well! well! we will reserve the grog till you have your three
thousand a year, and are ready to be married.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; When
will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made an estimate, some months since, of the capacities of
my business,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that estimate is correct,
I shall double my present income&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be married!&rdquo; added Obenreizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be married,&rdquo; repeated Vendale, &ldquo;within a year
from this time.&nbsp; Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>VENDALE MAKES MISCHIEF</h3>
<p>When Vendale entered his office the next morning, the dull commercial
routine at Cripple Corner met him with a new face.&nbsp; Marguerite
had an interest in it now!&nbsp; The whole machinery which Wilding&rsquo;s
death had set in motion, to realise the value of the business&mdash;the
balancing of ledgers, the estimating of debts, the taking of stock,
and the rest of it&mdash;was now transformed into machinery which indicated
the chances for and against a speedy marriage.&nbsp; After looking over
results, as presented by his accountant, and checking additions and
subtractions, as rendered by the clerks, Vendale turned his attention
to the stock-taking department next, and sent a message to the cellars,
desiring to see the report.</p>
<p>The Cellarman&rsquo;s appearance, the moment he put his head in at
the door of his master&rsquo;s private room, suggested that something
very extraordinary must have happened that morning.&nbsp; There was
an approach to alacrity in Joey Ladle&rsquo;s movements!&nbsp; There
was something which actually simulated cheerfulness in Joey Ladle&rsquo;s
face</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish to mention one thing,&rdquo; answered Joey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young Mr. Vendale, I have never set myself up for a prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who ever said you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No prophet, as far as I&rsquo;ve heard I tell of that profession,&rdquo;
proceeded Joey, &ldquo;ever lived principally underground.&nbsp; No
prophet, whatever else he might take in at the pores, ever took in wine
from morning to night, for a number of years together.&nbsp; When I
said to young Master Wilding, respecting his changing the name of the
firm, that one of these days he might find he&rsquo;d changed the luck
of the firm&mdash;did I put myself forward as a prophet?&nbsp; No, I
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Has what I said to him come true?&nbsp; Yes, it
has.&nbsp; In the time of Pebbleson Nephew, Young Mr. Vendale, no such
thing was ever known as a mistake made in a consignment delivered at
these doors.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a mistake been made now.&nbsp; Please
to remark that it happened before Miss Margaret came here.&nbsp; For
which reason it don&rsquo;t go against what I&rsquo;ve said respecting
Miss Margaret singing round the luck.&nbsp; Read that, sir,&rdquo; concluded
Joey, pointing attention to a special passage in the report, with a
forefinger which appeared to be in process of taking in through the
pores nothing more remarkable than dirt.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s foreign
to my nature to crow over the house I serve, but I feel it a kind of
solemn duty to ask you to read that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale read as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Note, respecting the Swiss
champagne.&nbsp; An irregularity has been discovered in the last consignment
received from the firm of Defresnier and Co.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vendale stopped,
and referred to a memorandum-book by his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was
in Mr. Wilding&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The vintage
was a particularly good one, and he took the whole of it.&nbsp; The
Swiss champagne has done very well, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s done badly,&rdquo; answered the
Cellarman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may have got sick in our customers&rsquo;
bins, or it may have bust in our customers&rsquo; hands.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s done badly with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale resumed the reading of the note: &ldquo;We find the number
of the cases to be quite correct by the books.&nbsp; But six of them,
which present a slight difference from the rest in the brand, have been
opened, and have been found to contain a red wine instead of champagne.&nbsp;
The similarity in the brands, we suppose, caused a mistake to be made
in sending the consignment from Neuch&acirc;tel.&nbsp; The error has
not been found to extend beyond six cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all!&rdquo; exclaimed Vendale, tossing the note away
from him.</p>
<p>Joey Ladle&rsquo;s eye followed the flying morsel of paper drearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you take it easy, sir,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever happens, it will be always a comfort to you to remember
that you took it easy at first.&nbsp; Sometimes one mistake leads to
another.&nbsp; A man drops a bit of orange-peel on the pavement by mistake,
and another man treads on it by mistake, and there&rsquo;s a job at
the hospital, and a party crippled for life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you
take it easy, sir.&nbsp; In Pebbleson Nephew&rsquo;s time we shouldn&rsquo;t
have taken it easy till we had seen the end of it.&nbsp; Without desiring
to crow over the house, young Mr. Vendale, I wish you well through it.&nbsp;
No offence, sir,&rdquo; said the Cellarman, opening the door to go out,
and looking in again ominously before he shut it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
muddled and molloncolly, I grant you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m an old servant
of Pebbleson Nephew, and I wish you well through them six cases of red
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left by himself, Vendale laughed, and took up his pen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
may as well send a line to Defresnier and Company,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;before I forget it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote at once in these terms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sirs.&nbsp; We are taking stock, and a trifling
mistake has been discovered in the last consignment of champagne sent
by your house to ours.&nbsp; Six of the cases contain red wine&mdash;which
we hereby return to you.&nbsp; The matter can easily be set right, either
by your sending us six cases of the champagne, if they can be produced,
or, if not, by your crediting us with the value of six cases on the
amount last paid (five hundred pounds) by our firm to yours.&nbsp; Your
faithful servants,</p>
<p>&ldquo;WILDING AND CO.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter despatched to the post, the subject dropped at once out
of Vendale&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He had other and far more interesting
matters to think of.&nbsp; Later in the day he paid the visit to Obenreizer
which had been agreed on between them.&nbsp; Certain evenings in the
week were set apart which he was privileged to spend with Marguerite&mdash;always,
however, in the presence of a third person.&nbsp; On this stipulation
Obenreizer politely but positively insisted.&nbsp; The one concession
he made was to give Vendale his choice of who the third person should
be.&nbsp; Confiding in past experience, his choice fell unhesitatingly
upon the excellent woman who mended Obenreizer&rsquo;s stockings.&nbsp;
On hearing of the responsibility entrusted to her, Madame Dor&rsquo;s
intellectual nature burst suddenly into a new stage of development.&nbsp;
She waited till Obenreizer&rsquo;s eye was off her&mdash;and then she
looked at Vendale, and dimly winked.</p>
<p>The time passed&mdash;the happy evenings with Marguerite came and
went.&nbsp; It was the tenth morning since Vendale had written to the
Swiss firm, when the answer appeared, on his desk, with the other letters
of the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sirs.&nbsp; We beg to offer our excuses for
the little mistake which has happened.&nbsp; At the same time, we regret
to add that the statement of our error, with which you have favoured
us, has led to a very unexpected discovery.&nbsp; The affair is a most
serious one for you and for us.&nbsp; The particulars are as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having no more champagne of the vintage last sent to you,
we made arrangements to credit your firm to the value of six cases,
as suggested by yourself.&nbsp; On taking this step, certain forms observed
in our mode of doing business necessitated a reference to our bankers&rsquo;
book, as well as to our ledger.&nbsp; The result is a moral certainty
that no such remittance as you mention can have reached our house, and
a literal certainty that no such remittance has been paid to our account
at the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is needless, at this stage of the proceedings, to trouble
you with details.&nbsp; The money has unquestionably been stolen in
the course of its transit from you to us.&nbsp; Certain peculiarities
which we observe, relating to the manner in which the fraud has been
perpetrated, lead us to conclude that the thief may have calculated
on being able to pay the missing sum to our bankers, before an inevitable
discovery followed the annual striking of our balance.&nbsp; This would
not have happened, in the usual course, for another three months.&nbsp;
During that period, but for your letter, we might have remained perfectly
unconscious of the robbery that has been committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mention this last circumstance, as it may help to show
you that we have to do, in this case, with no ordinary thief.&nbsp;
Thus far we have not even a suspicion of who that thief is.&nbsp; But
we believe you will assist us in making some advance towards discovery,
by examining the receipt (forged, of course) which has no doubt purported
to come to you from our house.&nbsp; Be pleased to look and see whether
it is a receipt entirely in manuscript, or whether it is a numbered
and printed form which merely requires the filling in of the amount.&nbsp;
The settlement of this apparently trivial question is, we assure you,
a matter of vital importance.&nbsp; Anxiously awaiting your reply, we
remain, with high esteem and consideration,</p>
<p>&ldquo;DEFRESNIER &amp; CIE.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vendale had the letter on his desk, and waited a moment to steady
his mind under the shock that had fallen on it.&nbsp; At the time of
all others when it was most important to him to increase the value of
his business, that business was threatened with a loss of five hundred
pounds.&nbsp; He thought of Marguerite, as he took the key from his
pocket and opened the iron chamber in the wall in which the books and
papers of the firm were kept.</p>
<p>He was still in the chamber, searching for the forged receipt, when
he was startled by a voice speaking close behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons,&rdquo; said the voice; &ldquo;I am afraid
I disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, and found himself face to face with Marguerite&rsquo;s
guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have called,&rdquo; pursued Obenreizer, &ldquo;to know if
I can be of any use.&nbsp; Business of my own takes me away for some
days to Manchester and Liverpool.&nbsp; Can I combine any business of
yours with it?&nbsp; I am entirely at your disposal, in the character
of commercial traveller for the firm of Wilding and Co.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for one moment,&rdquo; said Vendale; &ldquo;I will
speak to you directly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned round again, and continued
his search among the papers.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come at a time when friendly
offers are more than usually precious to me,&rdquo; he resumed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have had very bad news this morning from Neuch&acirc;tel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news,&rdquo; exclaimed Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;From Defresnier
and Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; A remittance we sent to them has been stolen.&nbsp;
I am threatened with a loss of five hundred pounds.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning sharply, and looking into the room for the second time, Vendale
discovered his envelope case overthrown on the floor, and Obenreizer
on his knees picking up the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my awkwardness,&rdquo; said Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
dreadful news of yours startled me; I stepped back&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
He became too deeply interested in collecting the scattered envelopes
to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
clerk will pick the things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dreadful news!&rdquo; repeated Obenreizer, persisting
in collecting the envelopes.&nbsp; &ldquo;This dreadful news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will read the letter,&rdquo; said Vendale, &ldquo;you
will find I have exaggerated nothing.&nbsp; There it is, open on my
desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his search, and in a moment more discovered the forged
receipt.&nbsp; It was on the numbered and printed form, described by
the Swiss firm.&nbsp; Vendale made a memorandum of the number and the
date.&nbsp; Having replaced the receipt and locked up the iron chamber,
he had leisure to notice Obenreizer, reading the letter in the recess
of a window at the far end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the fire,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look
perished with the cold out there.&nbsp; I will ring for some more coals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer rose, and came slowly back to the desk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marguerite
will be as sorry to hear of this as I am,&rdquo; he said, kindly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the hands of Defresnier and Company,&rdquo; answered
Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;In my total ignorance of the circumstances, I
can only do what they recommend.&nbsp; The receipt which I have just
found, turns out to be the numbered and printed form.&nbsp; They seem
to attach some special importance to its discovery.&nbsp; You have had
experience, when you were in the Swiss house, of their way of doing
business.&nbsp; Can you guess what object they have in view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer offered a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I examine the receipt?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; asked Vendale, startled by the change
in his face, which now showed itself plainly for the first time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray go to the fire.&nbsp; You seem to be shivering&mdash;I hope
you are not going to be ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; said Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I have
caught cold.&nbsp; Your English climate might have spared an admirer
of your English institutions.&nbsp; Let me look at the receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale opened the iron chamber.&nbsp; Obenreizer took a chair, and
drew it close to the fire.&nbsp; He held both hands over the flames.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me look at the receipt,&rdquo; he repeated, eagerly, as Vendale
reappeared with the paper in his hand.&nbsp; At the same moment a porter
entered the room with a fresh supply of coals.&nbsp; Vendale told him
to make a good fire.&nbsp; The man obeyed the order with a disastrous
alacrity.&nbsp; As he stepped forward and raised the scuttle, his foot
caught in a fold of the rug, and he discharged his entire cargo of coals
into the grate.&nbsp; The result was an instant smothering of the flame,
and the production of a stream of yellow smoke, without a visible morsel
of fire to account for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imbecile!&rdquo; whispered Obenreizer to himself, with a look
at the man which the man remembered for many a long day afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come into the clerks&rsquo; room?&rdquo; asked Vendale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They have a stove there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; No matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale handed him the receipt.&nbsp; Obenreizer&rsquo;s interest
in examining it appeared to have been quenched as suddenly and as effectually
as the fire itself.&nbsp; He just glanced over the document, and said,
&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t understand it!&nbsp; I am sorry to be of no
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write to Neuch&acirc;tel by to-night&rsquo;s post,&rdquo;
said Vendale, putting away the receipt for the second time.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
must wait, and see what comes of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By to-night&rsquo;s post,&rdquo; repeated Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me see.&nbsp; You will get the answer in eight or nine days&rsquo;
time.&nbsp; I shall be back before that.&nbsp; If I can be of any service,
as commercial traveller, perhaps you will let me know between this and
then.&nbsp; You will send me written instructions?&nbsp; My best thanks.&nbsp;
I shall be most anxious for your answer from Neuch&acirc;tel.&nbsp;
Who knows?&nbsp; It may be a mistake, my dear friend, after all.&nbsp;
Courage! courage! courage!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had entered the room with
no appearance of being pressed for time.&nbsp; He now snatched up his
hat, and took his leave with the air of a man who had not another moment
to lose.</p>
<p>Left by himself, Vendale took a turn thoughtfully in the room.</p>
<p>His previous impression of Obenreizer was shaken by what he had heard
and seen at the interview which had just taken place.&nbsp; He was disposed,
for the first time, to doubt whether, in this case, he had not been
a little hasty and hard in his judgment on another man.&nbsp; Obenreizer&rsquo;s
surprise and regret, on hearing the news from Neuch&acirc;tel, bore
the plainest marks of being honestly felt&mdash;not politely assumed
for the occasion.&nbsp; With troubles of his own to encounter, suffering,
to all appearance, from the first insidious attack of a serious illness,
he had looked and spoken like a man who really deplored the disaster
that had fallen on his friend.&nbsp; Hitherto Vendale had tried vainly
to alter his first opinion of Marguerite&rsquo;s guardian, for Marguerite&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; All the generous instincts in his nature now combined together
and shook the evidence which had seemed unanswerable up to this time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may have read that
man&rsquo;s face wrongly, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time passed&mdash;the happy evenings with Marguerite came and
went.&nbsp; It was again the tenth morning since Vendale had written
to the Swiss firm; and again the answer appeared on his desk with the
other letters of the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sir.&nbsp; My senior partner, M. Defresnier,
has been called away, by urgent business, to Milan.&nbsp; In his absence
(and with his full concurrence and authority), I now write to you again
on the subject of the missing five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your discovery that the forged receipt is executed upon one
of our numbered and printed forms has caused inexpressible surprise
and distress to my partner and to myself.&nbsp; At the time when your
remittance was stolen, but three keys were in existence opening the
strong-box in which our receipt-forms are invariably kept.&nbsp; My
partner had one key; I had the other.&nbsp; The third was in the possession
of a gentleman who, at that period, occupied a position of trust in
our house.&nbsp; We should as soon have thought of suspecting one of
ourselves as of suspecting this person.&nbsp; Suspicion now points at
him, nevertheless.&nbsp; I cannot prevail on myself to inform you who
the person is, so long as there is the shadow of a chance that he may
come innocently out of the inquiry which must now be instituted.&nbsp;
Forgive my silence; the motive of it is good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The form our investigation must now take is simple enough.&nbsp;
The handwriting of your receipt must be compared, by competent persons
whom we have at our disposal, with certain specimens of handwriting
in our possession.&nbsp; I cannot send you the specimens for business
reasons, which, when you hear them, you are sure to approve.&nbsp; I
must beg you to send me the receipt to Neuch&acirc;tel&mdash;and, in
making this request, I must accompany it by a word of necessary warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the person, at whom suspicion now points, really proves
to be the person who has committed this forger and theft, I have reason
to fear that circumstances may have already put him on his guard.&nbsp;
The only evidence against him is the evidence in your hands, and he
will move heaven and earth to obtain and destroy it.&nbsp; I strongly
urge you not to trust the receipt to the post.&nbsp; Send it to me,
without loss of time, by a private hand, and choose nobody for your
messenger but a person long established in your own employment, accustomed
to travelling, capable of speaking French; a man of courage, a man of
honesty, and, above all things, a man who can be trusted to let no stranger
scrape acquaintance with him on the route.&nbsp; Tell no one&mdash;absolutely
no one&mdash;but your messenger of the turn this matter has now taken.&nbsp;
The safe transit of the receipt may depend on your interpreting <i>literally</i>
the advice which I give you at the end of this letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only to add that every possible saving of time is now
of the last importance.&nbsp; More than one of our receipt-forms is
missing&mdash;and it is impossible to say what new frauds may not be
committed if we fail to lay our hands on the thief.</p>
<p>Your faithful servant<br />
ROLLAND,<br />
(Signing for Defresnier and Cie.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who was the suspected man?&nbsp; In Vendale&rsquo;s position, it
seemed useless to inquire.</p>
<p>Who was to be sent to Neuch&acirc;tel with the receipt?&nbsp; Men
of courage and men of honesty were to be had at Cripple Corner for the
asking.&nbsp; But where was the man who was accustomed to foreign travelling,
who could speak the French language, and who could be really relied
on to let no stranger scrape acquaintance with him on his route?&nbsp;
There was but one man at hand who combined all those requisites in his
own person, and that man was Vendale himself.</p>
<p>It was a sacrifice to leave his business; it was a greater sacrifice
to leave Marguerite.&nbsp; But a matter of five hundred pounds was involved
in the pending inquiry; and a literal interpretation of M. Rolland&rsquo;s
advice was insisted on in terms which there was no trifling with.&nbsp;
The more Vendale thought of it, the more plainly the necessity faced
him, and said, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he locked up the letter with the receipt, the association of ideas
reminded him of Obenreizer.&nbsp; A guess at the identity of the suspected
man looked more possible now.&nbsp; Obenreizer might know.</p>
<p>The thought had barely passed through his mind, when the door opened,
and Obenreizer entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me at Soho Square you were expected back last night,&rdquo;
said Vendale, greeting him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you done well in the country?&nbsp;
Are you better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thousand thanks.&nbsp; Obenreizer had done admirably well; Obenreizer
was infinitely better.&nbsp; And now, what news?&nbsp; Any letter from
Neuch&acirc;tel?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very strange letter,&rdquo; answered Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
matter has taken a new turn, and the letter insists&mdash;without excepting
anybody&mdash;on my keeping our next proceedings a profound secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without excepting anybody?&rdquo; repeated Obenreizer.&nbsp;
As he said the words, he walked away again, thoughtfully, to the window
at the other end of the room, looked out for a moment, and suddenly
came back to Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely they must have forgotten?&rdquo;
he resumed, &ldquo;or they would have excepted me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Monsieur Rolland who writes,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, as you say, he must certainly have forgotten.&nbsp; That
view of the matter quite escaped me.&nbsp; I was just wishing I had
you to consult, when you came into the room.&nbsp; And here I am tried
by a formal prohibition, which cannot possibly have been intended to
include you.&nbsp; How very annoying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer&rsquo;s filmy eyes fixed on Vendale attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is more than annoying!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
came this morning not only to hear the news, but to offer myself as
messenger, negotiator&mdash;what you will.&nbsp; Would you believe it?&nbsp;
I have letters which oblige me to go to Switzerland immediately.&nbsp;
Messages, documents, anything&mdash;I could have taken them all to Defresnier
and Rolland for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the very man I wanted,&rdquo; returned Vendale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had decided, most unwillingly, on going to Neuch&acirc;tel
myself, not five minutes since, because I could find no one here capable
of taking my place.&nbsp; Let me look at the letter again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the strong room to get at the letter.&nbsp; Obenreizer,
after first glancing round him to make sure that they were alone, followed
a step or two and waited, measuring Vendale with his eye.&nbsp; Vendale
was the tallest man, and unmistakably the strongest man also of the
two.&nbsp; Obenreizer turned away, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vendale read the last paragraph in the letter for the
third time.&nbsp; There was the plain warning&mdash;there was the closing
sentence, which insisted on a literal interpretation of it.&nbsp; The
hand, which was leading Vendale in the dark, led him on that condition
only.&nbsp; A large sum was at stake: a terrible suspicion remained
to be verified.&nbsp; If he acted on his own responsibility, and if
anything happened to defeat the object in view, who would be blamed?&nbsp;
As a man of business, Vendale had but one course to follow.&nbsp; He
locked the letter up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most annoying,&rdquo; he said to Obenreizer&mdash;&ldquo;it
is a piece of forgetfulness on Monsieur Rolland&rsquo;s part which puts
me to serious inconvenience, and places me in an absurdly false position
towards you.&nbsp; What am I to do?&nbsp; I am acting in a very serious
matter, and acting entirely in the dark.&nbsp; I have no choice but
to be guided, not by the spirit, but by the letter of my instructions.&nbsp;
You understand me, I am sure?&nbsp; You know, if I had not been fettered
in this way, how gladly I should have accepted your services?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more!&rdquo; returned Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;In your
place I should have done the same.&nbsp; My good friend, I take no offence.&nbsp;
I thank you for your compliment.&nbsp; We shall be travelling companions,
at any rate,&rdquo; added Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go, as I go,
at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once.&nbsp; I must speak to Marguerite first, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely! surely!&nbsp; Speak to her this evening.&nbsp; Come,
and pick me up on the way to the station.&nbsp; We go together by the
mail train to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the mail train to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It was later than Vendale had anticipated when he drove up to the
house in Soho Square.&nbsp; Business difficulties, occasioned by his
sudden departure, had presented themselves by dozens.&nbsp; A cruelly
large share of the time which he had hoped to devote to Marguerite had
been claimed by duties at his office which it was impossible to neglect.</p>
<p>To his surprise and delight, she was alone in the drawing-room when
he entered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have only a few minutes, George,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But Madame Dor has been good to me&mdash;and we can have those
few minutes alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; She threw her arms round his neck, and
whispered eagerly, &ldquo;Have you done anything to offend Mr. Obenreizer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Vendale, in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want to whisper it.&nbsp;
You know the little photograph I have got of you.&nbsp; This afternoon
it happened to be on the chimney-piece.&nbsp; He took it up and looked
at it&mdash;and I saw his face in the glass.&nbsp; I know you have offended
him!&nbsp; He is merciless; he is revengeful; he is as secret as the
grave.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go with him, George&mdash;don&rsquo;t go with
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own love,&rdquo; returned Vendale, &ldquo;you are letting
your fancy frighten you!&nbsp; Obenreizer and I were never better friends
than we are at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before a word more could be said, the sudden movement of some ponderous
body shook the floor of the next room.&nbsp; The shock was followed
by the appearance of Madame Dor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Obenreizer&rdquo; exclaimed
this excellent person in a whisper, and plumped down instantly in her
regular place by the stove.</p>
<p>Obenreizer came in with a courier&rsquo;s big strapped over his shoulder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked, addressing Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can
I take anything for you?&nbsp; You have no travelling-bag.&nbsp; I have
got one.&nbsp; Here is the compartment for papers, open at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have only one
paper of importance with me; and that paper I am bound to take charge
of myself.&nbsp; Here it is,&rdquo; he added, touching the breast-pocket
of his coat, &ldquo;and here it must remain till we get to Neuch&acirc;tel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said those words, Marguerite&rsquo;s hand caught his, and pressed
it significantly.&nbsp; She was looking towards Obenreizer.&nbsp; Before
Vendale could look, in his turn, Obenreizer had wheeled round, and was
taking leave of Madame Dor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu, my charming niece!&rdquo; he said, turning to Marguerite
next.&nbsp; &ldquo;En route, my friend, for Neuch&acirc;tel!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He tapped Vendale lightly over the breast-pocket of his coat and led
the way to the door.</p>
<p>Vendale&rsquo;s last look was for Marguerite.&nbsp; Marguerite&rsquo;s
last words to him were, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>ACT III.</h2>
<h3>IN THE VALLEY</h3>
<p>It was about the middle of the month of February when Vendale and
Obenreizer set forth on their expedition.&nbsp; The winter being a hard
one, the time was bad for travellers.&nbsp; So bad was it that these
two travellers, coming to Strasbourg, found its great inns almost empty.&nbsp;
And even the few people they did encounter in that city, who had started
from England or from Paris on business journeys towards the interior
of Switzerland, were turning back.</p>
<p>Many of the railroads in Switzerland that tourists pass easily enough
now, were almost or quite impracticable then.&nbsp; Some were not begun;
more were not completed.&nbsp; On such as were open, there were still
large gaps of old road where communication in the winter season was
often stopped; on others, there were weak points where the new work
was not safe, either under conditions of severe frost, or of rapid thaw.&nbsp;
The running of trains on this last class was not to be counted on in
the worst time of the year, was contingent upon weather, or was wholly
abandoned through the months considered the most dangerous.</p>
<p>At Strasbourg there were more travellers&rsquo; stories afloat, respecting
the difficulties of the way further on, than there were travellers to
relate them.&nbsp; Many of these tales were as wild as usual; but the
more modestly marvellous did derive some colour from the circumstance
that people were indisputably turning back.&nbsp; However, as the road
to Basle was open, Vendale&rsquo;s resolution to push on was in no wise
disturbed.&nbsp; Obenreizer&rsquo;s resolution was necessarily Vendale&rsquo;s,
seeing that he stood at bay thus desperately: He must be ruined, or
must destroy the evidence that Vendale carried about him, even if he
destroyed Vendale with it.</p>
<p>The state of mind of each of these two fellow-travellers towards
the other was this.&nbsp; Obenreizer, encircled by impending ruin through
Vendale&rsquo;s quickness of action, and seeing the circle narrowed
every hour by Vendale&rsquo;s energy, hated him with the animosity of
a fierce cunning lower animal.&nbsp; He had always had instinctive movements
in his breast against him; perhaps, because of that old sore of gentleman
and peasant; perhaps, because of the openness of his nature, perhaps,
because of his better looks; perhaps, because of his success with Marguerite;
perhaps, on all those grounds, the two last not the least.&nbsp; And
now he saw in him, besides, the hunter who was tracking him down.&nbsp;
Vendale, on the other hand, always contending generously against his
first vague mistrust, now felt bound to contend against it more than
ever: reminding himself, &ldquo;He is Marguerite&rsquo;s guardian.&nbsp;
We are on perfectly friendly terms; he is my companion of his own proposal,
and can have no interested motive in sharing this undesirable journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To which pleas in behalf of Obenreizer, chance added one consideration
more, when they came to Basle after a journey of more than twice the
average duration.</p>
<p>They had had a late dinner, and were alone in an inn room there,
overhanging the Rhine: at that place rapid and deep, swollen and loud.&nbsp;
Vendale lounged upon a couch, and Obenreizer walked to and fro: now,
stopping at the window, looking at the crooked reflection of the town
lights in the dark water (and peradventure thinking, &ldquo;If I could
fling him into it!&rdquo;); now, resuming his walk with his eyes upon
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I rob him, if I can?&nbsp; Where shall I murder
him, if I must?&rdquo;&nbsp; So, as he paced the room, ran the river,
ran the river, ran the river.</p>
<p>The burden seemed to him, at last, to be growing so plain, that he
stopped; thinking it as well to suggest another burden to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rhine sounds to-night,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;like
the old waterfall at home.&nbsp; That waterfall which my mother showed
to travellers (I told you of it once).&nbsp; The sound of it changed
with the weather, as does the sound of all falling waters and flowing
waters.&nbsp; When I was pupil of the watchmaker, I remembered it as
sometimes saying to me for whole days, &lsquo;Who are you, my little
wretch?&nbsp; Who are you, my little wretch?&rsquo;&nbsp; I remembered
it as saying, other times, when its sound was hollow, and storm was
coming up the Pass: &lsquo;Boom, boom, boom.&nbsp; Beat him, beat him,
beat him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Like my mother enraged&mdash;if she was my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she was?&rdquo; said Vendale, gradually changing his attitude
to a sitting one.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she was?&nbsp; Why do you say &lsquo;if&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know?&rdquo; replied the other negligently, throwing
up his hands and letting them fall as they would.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
would you have?&nbsp; I am so obscurely born, that how can I say?&nbsp;
I was very young, and all the rest of the family were men and women,
and my so-called parents were old.&nbsp; Anything is possible of a case
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever doubt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you once, I doubt the marriage of those two,&rdquo;
he replied, throwing up his hands again, as if he were throwing the
unprofitable subject away.&nbsp; &ldquo;But here I am in Creation.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> come of no fine family.&nbsp; What does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you are Swiss,&rdquo; said Vendale, after following
him with his eyes to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; he retorted abruptly, and stopping to
look back over his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say to you, at least you
are English.&nbsp; How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what I have been told from infancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I know of myself that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Vendale, pursuing the thought that he could
not drive back, &ldquo;by my earliest recollections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also.&nbsp; I know of myself that way&mdash;if that way
satisfies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it not satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must.&nbsp; There is nothing like &lsquo;it must&rsquo;
in this little world.&nbsp; It must.&nbsp; Two short words those, but
stronger than long proof or reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and poor Wilding were born in the same year.&nbsp; You
were nearly of an age,&rdquo; said Vendale, again thoughtfully looking
after him as he resumed his pacing up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Very nearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could Obenreizer be the missing man?&nbsp; In the unknown associations
of things, was there a subtler meaning than he himself thought, in that
theory so often on his lips about the smallness of the world?&nbsp;
Had the Swiss letter presenting him followed so close on Mrs. Goldstraw&rsquo;s
revelation concerning the infant who had been taken away to Switzerland,
because he was that infant grown a man?&nbsp; In a world where so many
depths lie unsounded, it might be.&nbsp; The chances, or the laws&mdash;call
them either&mdash;that had wrought out the revival of Vendale&rsquo;s
own acquaintance with Obenreizer, and had ripened it into intimacy,
and had brought them here together this present winter night, were hardly
less curious; while read by such a light, they were seen to cohere towards
the furtherance of a continuous and an intelligible purpose.</p>
<p>Vendale&rsquo;s awakened thoughts ran high while his eyes musingly
followed Obenreizer pacing up and down the room, the river ever running
to the tune: &ldquo;Where shall I rob him, if I can?&nbsp; Where shall
I murder him, if I must?&rdquo;&nbsp; The secret of his dead friend
was in no hazard from Vendale&rsquo;s lips; but just as his friend had
died of its weight, so did he in his lighter succession feel the burden
of the trust, and the obligation to follow any clue, however obscure.&nbsp;
He rapidly asked himself, would he like this man to be the real Wilding?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; Argue down his mistrust as he might, he was unwilling to put
such a substitute in the place of his late guileless, outspoken childlike
partner.&nbsp; He rapidly asked himself, would he like this man to be
rich?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; He had more power than enough over Marguerite
as it was, and wealth might invest him with more.&nbsp; Would he like
this man to be Marguerite&rsquo;s Guardian, and yet proved to stand
in no degree of relationship towards her, however disconnected and distant?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; But these were not considerations to come between him and
fidelity to the dead.&nbsp; Let him see to it that they passed him with
no other notice than the knowledge that they <i>had</i> passed him,
and left him bent on the discharge of a solemn duty.&nbsp; And he did
see to it, so soon that he followed his companion with ungrudging eyes,
while he still paced the room; that companion, whom he supposed to be
moodily reflecting on his own birth, and not on another man&rsquo;s&mdash;least
of all what man&rsquo;s&mdash;violent Death.</p>
<p>The road in advance from Basle to Neuch&acirc;tel was better than
had been represented.&nbsp; The latest weather had done it good.&nbsp;
Drivers, both of horses and mules, had come in that evening after dark,
and had reported nothing more difficult to be overcome than trials of
patience, harness, wheels, axles, and whipcord.&nbsp; A bargain was
soon struck for a carriage and horses, to take them on in the morning,
and to start before daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you lock your door at night when travelling?&rdquo; asked
Obenreizer, standing warming his hands by the wood fire in Vendale&rsquo;s
chamber, before going to his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I.&nbsp; I sleep too soundly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so sound a sleeper?&rdquo; he retorted, with an admiring
look.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a blessing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything but a blessing to the rest of the house,&rdquo; rejoined
Vendale, &ldquo;if I had to be knocked up in the morning from the outside
of my bedroom door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, &ldquo;leave open my room.&nbsp;
But let me advise you, as a Swiss who knows: always, when you travel
in my country, put your papers&mdash;and, of course, your money&mdash;under
your pillow.&nbsp; Always the same place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not complimentary to your countrymen,&rdquo; laughed
Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My countrymen,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, with that light touch
of his friend&rsquo;s elbows by way of Good-Night and benediction, &ldquo;I
suppose are like the majority of men.&nbsp; And the majority of men
will take what they can get.&nbsp; Adieu!&nbsp; At four in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu!&nbsp; At four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left to himself, Vendale raked the logs together, sprinkled over
them the white wood-ashes lying on the hearth, and sat down to compose
his thoughts.&nbsp; But they still ran high on their latest theme, and
the running of the river tended to agitate rather than to quiet them.&nbsp;
As he sat thinking, what little disposition he had had to sleep departed.&nbsp;
He felt it hopeless to lie down yet, and sat dressed by the fire.&nbsp;
Marguerite, Wilding, Obenreizer, the business he was then upon, and
a thousand hopes and doubts that had nothing to do with it, occupied
his mind at once.&nbsp; Everything seemed to have power over him but
slumber.&nbsp; The departed disposition to sleep kept far away.</p>
<p>He had sat for a long time thinking, on the hearth, when his candle
burned down and its light went out.&nbsp; It was of little moment; there
was light enough in the fire.&nbsp; He changed his attitude, and, leaning
his arm on the chair-back, and his chin upon that hand, sat thinking
still.</p>
<p>But he sat between the fire and the bed, and, as the fire flickered
in the play of air from the fast-flowing river, his enlarged shadow
fluttered on the white wall by the bedside.&nbsp; His attitude gave
it an air, half of mourning and half of bending over the bed imploring.&nbsp;
His eyes were observant of it, when he became troubled by the disagreeable
fancy that it was like Wilding&rsquo;s shadow, and not his own.</p>
<p>A slight change of place would cause it to disappear.&nbsp; He made
the change, and the apparition of his disturbed fancy vanished.&nbsp;
He now sat in the shade of a little nook beside the fire, and the door
of the room was before him.</p>
<p>It had a long cumbrous iron latch.&nbsp; He saw the latch slowly
and softly rise.&nbsp; The door opened a very little, and came to again,
as though only the air had moved it.&nbsp; But he saw that the latch
was out of the hasp.</p>
<p>The door opened again very slowly, until it opened wide enough to
admit some one.&nbsp; It afterwards remained still for a while, as though
cautiously held open on the other side.&nbsp; The figure of a man then
entered, with its face turned towards the bed, and stood quiet just
within the door.&nbsp; Until it said, in a low half-whisper, at the
same time taking one stop forward: &ldquo;Vendale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he answered, springing from his seat; &ldquo;who
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Obenreizer, and he uttered a cry of surprise as Vendale came
upon him from that unexpected direction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in bed?&rdquo;
he said, catching him by both shoulders with an instinctive tendency
to a struggle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then something <i>is</i> wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Vendale, releasing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First tell me; you are not ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill?&nbsp; No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a bad dream about you.&nbsp; How is it that I see
you up and dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good fellow, I may as well ask you how it is that I see
<i>you</i> up and undressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you why.&nbsp; I have had a bad dream about you.&nbsp;
I tried to rest after it, but it was impossible.&nbsp; I could not make
up my mind to stay where I was without knowing you were safe; and yet
I could not make up my mind to come in here.&nbsp; I have been minutes
hesitating at the door.&nbsp; It is so easy to laugh at a dream that
you have not dreamed.&nbsp; Where is your candle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burnt out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a whole one in my room.&nbsp; Shall I fetch it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His room was very near, and he was absent for but a few seconds.&nbsp;
Coming back with the candle in his hand, he kneeled down on the hearth
and lighted it.&nbsp; As he blew with his breath a charred billet into
flame for the purpose, Vendale, looking down at him, saw that his lips
were white and not easy of control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Obenreizer, setting the lighted candle on
the table, &ldquo;it was a bad dream.&nbsp; Only look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His feet were bare; his red-flannel shirt was thrown back at the
throat, and its sleeves were rolled above the elbows; his only other
garment, a pair of under pantaloons or drawers, reaching to the ankles,
fitted him close and tight.&nbsp; A certain lithe and savage appearance
was on his figure, and his eyes were very bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there had been a wrestle with a robber, as I dreamed,&rdquo;
said Obenreizer, &ldquo;you see, I was stripped for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And armed too,&rdquo; said Vendale, glancing at his girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A traveller&rsquo;s dagger, that I always carry on the road,&rdquo;
he answered carelessly, half drawing it from its sheath with his left
hand, and putting it back again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you carry no such thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pistols?&rdquo; said Obenreizer, glancing at the table,
and from it to the untouched pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Englishmen are so confident!&nbsp; You wish to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wished to sleep this long time, but I can&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither, after the bad dream.&nbsp; My fire has gone the
way of your candle.&nbsp; May I come and sit by yours?&nbsp; Two o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp;
It will so soon be four, that it is not worth the trouble to go to bed
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not take the trouble to go to bed at all, now,&rdquo;
said Vendale; &ldquo;sit here and keep me company, and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going back to his room to arrange his dress, Obenreizer soon returned
in a loose cloak and slippers, and they sat down on opposite sides of
the hearth.&nbsp; In the interval Vendale had replenished the fire from
the wood-basket in his room, and Obenreizer had put upon the table a
flask and cup from his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common cabaret brandy, I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, pouring
out; &ldquo;bought upon the road, and not like yours from Cripple Corner.&nbsp;
But yours is exhausted; so much the worse.&nbsp; A cold night, a cold
time of night, a cold country, and a cold house.&nbsp; This may be better
than nothing; try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale took the cup, and did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a coarse after-flavour,&rdquo; said Vendale, giving
back the cup with a slight shudder, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, tasting, and smacking
his lips; &ldquo;it <i>has</i> a coarse after-flavour, and <i>I</i>
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; Booh!&nbsp; It burns, though!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had flung what remained in the cup upon the fire.</p>
<p>Each of them leaned an elbow on the table, reclined his head upon
his hand, and sat looking at the flaring logs.&nbsp; Obenreizer remained
watchful and still; but Vendale, after certain nervous twitches and
starts, in one of which he rose to his feet and looked wildly about
him, fell into the strangest confusion of dreams.&nbsp; He carried his
papers in a leather case or pocket-book, in an inner breast-pocket of
his buttoned travelling-coat; and whatever he dreamed of, in the lethargy
that got possession of him, something importunate in those papers called
him out of that dream, though he could not wake from it.&nbsp; He was
berated on the steppes of Russia (some shadowy person gave that name
to the place) with Marguerite; and yet the sensation of a hand at his
breast, softly feeling the outline of the packet-book as he lay asleep
before the fire, was present to him.&nbsp; He was ship-wrecked in an
open boat at sea, and having lost his clothes, had no other covering
than an old sail; and yet a creeping hand, tracing outside all the other
pockets of the dress he actually wore, for papers, and finding none
answer its touch, warned him to rouse himself.&nbsp; He was in the ancient
vault at Cripple Corner, to which was transferred the very bed substantial
and present in that very room at Basle; and Wilding (not dead, as he
had supposed, and yet he did not wonder much) shook him, and whispered,
&ldquo;Look at that man!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see he has risen, and
is turning the pillow?&nbsp; Why should he turn the pillow, if not to
seek those papers that are in your breast?&nbsp; Awake!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet he slept, and wandered off into other dreams.</p>
<p>Watchful and still, with his elbow on the table, and his head upon
that hand, his companion at length said: &ldquo;Vendale!&nbsp; We are
called.&nbsp; Past Four!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, opening his eyes, he saw,
turned sideways on him, the filmy face of Obenreizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been in a heavy sleep,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
fatigue of constant travelling and the cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am broad awake now,&rdquo; cried Vendale, springing up,
but with an unsteady footing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you slept at
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have dozed, but I seem to have been patiently looking
at the fire.&nbsp; Whether or no, we must wash, and breakfast, and turn
out.&nbsp; Past four, Vendale; past four!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said in a tone to rouse him, for already he was half asleep
again.&nbsp; In his preparation for the day, too, and at his breakfast,
he was often virtually asleep while in mechanical action.&nbsp; It was
not until the cold dark day was closing in, that he had any distincter
impressions of the ride than jingling bells, bitter weather, slipping
horses, frowning hill-sides, bleak woods, and a stoppage at some wayside
house of entertainment, where they had passed through a cow-house to
reach the travellers&rsquo; room above.&nbsp; He had been conscious
of little more, except of Obenreizer sitting thoughtful at his side
all day, and eyeing him much.</p>
<p>But when he shook off his stupor, Obenreizer was not at his side.&nbsp;
The carriage was stopping to bait at another wayside house; and a line
of long narrow carts, laden with casks of wine, and drawn by horses
with a quantity of blue collar and head-gear, were baiting too.&nbsp;
These came from the direction in which the travellers were going, and
Obenreizer (not thoughtful now, but cheerful and alert) was talking
with the foremost driver.&nbsp; As Vendale stretched his limbs, circulated
his blood, and cleared off the lees of his lethargy, with a sharp run
to and fro in the bracing air, the line of carts moved on: the drivers
all saluting Obenreizer as they passed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those?&rdquo; asked Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are our carriers&mdash;Defresnier and Company&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
replied Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those are our casks of wine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was singing to himself, and lighting a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been drearily dull company to-day,&rdquo; said Vendale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what has been the matter with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no sleep last night; and a kind of brain-congestion
frequently comes, at first, of such cold,&rdquo; said Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have seen it often.&nbsp; After all, we shall have our journey
for nothing, it seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How for nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The House is at Milan.&nbsp; You know, we are a Wine House
at Neuch&acirc;tel, and a Silk House at Milan?&nbsp; Well, Silk happening
to press of a sudden, more than Wine, Defresnier was summoned to Milan.&nbsp;
Rolland, the other partner, has been taken ill since his departure,
and the doctors will allow him to see no one.&nbsp; A letter awaits
you at Neuch&acirc;tel to tell you so.&nbsp; I have it from our chief
carrier whom you saw me talking with.&nbsp; He was surprised to see
me, and said he had that word for you if he met you.&nbsp; What do you
do?&nbsp; Go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Across the Alps, and down to Milan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer stopped in his smoking to look at Vendale, and then smoked
heavily, looked up the road, looked down the road, looked down at the
stones in the road at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a very serious matter in charge,&rdquo; said Vendale;
&ldquo;more of these missing forms may be turned to as bad account,
or worse: I am urged to lose no time in helping the House to take the
thief; and nothing shall turn me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; cried Obenreizer, taking out his cigar to smile,
and giving his hand to his fellow-traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then nothing
shall turn <i>me</i> back.&nbsp; Ho, driver!&nbsp; Despatch.&nbsp; Quick
there!&nbsp; Let us push on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They travelled through the night.&nbsp; There had been snow, and
there was a partial thaw, and they mostly travelled at a foot-pace,
and always with many stoppages to breathe the splashed and floundering
horses.&nbsp; After an hour&rsquo;s broad daylight, they drew rein at
the inn-door at Neuch&acirc;tel, having been some eight-and-twenty hours
in conquering some eighty English miles.</p>
<p>When they had hurriedly refreshed and changed, they went together
to the house of business of Defresnier and Company.&nbsp; There they
found the letter which the wine-carrier had described, enclosing the
tests and comparisons of handwriting essential to the discovery of the
Forger.&nbsp; Vendale&rsquo;s determination to press forward, without
resting, being already taken, the only question to delay them was by
what Pass could they cross the Alps?&nbsp; Respecting the state of the
two Passes of the St. Gotthard and the Simplon, the guides and mule-drivers
differed greatly; and both passes were still far enough off, to prevent
the travellers from having the benefit of any recent experience of either.&nbsp;
Besides which, they well knew that a fall of snow might altogether change
the described conditions in a single hour, even if they were correctly
stated.&nbsp; But, on the whole, the Simplon appearing to be the hopefuller
route, Vendale decided to take it.&nbsp; Obenreizer bore little or no
part in the discussion, and scarcely spoke.</p>
<p>To Geneva, to Lausanne, along the level margin of the lake to Vevay,
so into the winding valley between the spurs of the mountains, and into
the valley of the Rhone.&nbsp; The sound of the carriage-wheels, as
they rattled on, through the day, through the night, became as the wheels
of a great clock, recording the hours.&nbsp; No change of weather varied
the journey, after it had hardened into a sullen frost.&nbsp; In a sombre-yellow
sky, they saw the Alpine ranges; and they saw enough of snow on nearer
and much lower hill-tops and hill-sides, to sully, by contrast, the
purity of lake, torrent, and waterfall, and make the villages look discoloured
and dirty.&nbsp; But no snow fell, nor was there any snow-drift on the
road.&nbsp; The stalking along the valley of more or less of white mist,
changing on their hair and dress into icicles, was the only variety
between them and the gloomy sky.&nbsp; And still by day, and still by
night, the wheels.&nbsp; And still they rolled, in the hearing of one
of them, to the burden, altered from the burden of the Rhine: &ldquo;The
time is gone for robbing him alive, and I must murder him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came, at length, to the poor little town of Brieg, at the foot
of the Simplon.&nbsp; They came there after dark, but yet could see
how dwarfed men&rsquo;s works and men became with the immense mountains
towering over them.&nbsp; Here they must lie for the night; and here
was warmth of fire, and lamp, and dinner, and wine, and after-conference
resounding, with guides and drivers.&nbsp; No human creature had come
across the Pass for four days.&nbsp; The snow above the snow-line was
too soft for wheeled carriage, and not hard enough for sledge.&nbsp;
There was snow in the sky.&nbsp; There had been snow in the sky for
days past, and the marvel was that it had not fallen, and the certainty
was that it must fall.&nbsp; No vehicle could cross.&nbsp; The journey
might be tried on mules, or it might be tried on foot; but the best
guides must be paid danger-price in either case, and that, too, whether
they succeeded in taking the two travellers across, or turned for safety
and brought them back.</p>
<p>In this discussion, Obenreizer bore no part whatever.&nbsp; He sat
silently smoking by the fire until the room was cleared and Vendale
referred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&nbsp; I am weary of these poor devils and their trade,&rdquo;
he said, in reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always the same story.&nbsp; It is the
story of their trade to-day, as it was the story of their trade when
I was a ragged boy.&nbsp; What do you and I want?&nbsp; We want a knapsack
each, and a mountain-staff each.&nbsp; We want no guide; we should guide
him; he would not guide us.&nbsp; We leave our portmanteaus here, and
we cross together.&nbsp; We have been on the mountains together before
now, and I am mountain-born, and I know this Pass&mdash;Pass!&mdash;rather
High Road!&mdash;by heart.&nbsp; We will leave these poor devils, in
pity, to trade with others; but they must not delay us to make a pretence
of earning money.&nbsp; Which is all they mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale, glad to be quit of the dispute, and to cut the knot: active,
adventurous, bent on getting forward, and therefore very susceptible
to the last hint: readily assented.&nbsp; Within two hours, they had
purchased what they wanted for the expedition, had packed their knapsacks,
and lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>At break of day, they found half the town collected in the narrow
street to see them depart.&nbsp; The people talked together in groups;
the guides and drivers whispered apart, and looked up at the sky; no
one wished them a good journey.</p>
<p>As they began the ascent, a gleam of run shone from the otherwise
unaltered sky, and for a moment turned the tin spires of the town to
silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good omen!&rdquo; said Vendale (though it died out while
he spoke).&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps our example will open the Pass on this
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we shall not be followed,&rdquo; returned Obenreizer,
looking up at the sky and back at the valley.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall
be alone up yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>ON THE MOUNTAIN</h3>
<p>The road was fair enough for stout walkers, and the air grew lighter
and easier to breathe as the two ascended.&nbsp; But the settled gloom
remained as it had remained for days back.&nbsp; Nature seemed to have
come to a pause.&nbsp; The sense of hearing, no less than the sense
of sight, was troubled by having to wait so long for the change, whatever
it might be, that impended.&nbsp; The silence was as palpable and heavy
as the lowering clouds&mdash;or rather cloud, for there seemed to be
but one in all the sky, and that one covering the whole of it.</p>
<p>Although the light was thus dismally shrouded, the prospect was not
obscured.&nbsp; Down in the valley of the Rhone behind them, the stream
could be traced through all its many windings, oppressively sombre and
solemn in its one leaden hue, a colourless waste.&nbsp; Far and high
above them, glaciers and suspended avalanches overhung the spots where
they must pass, by-and-by; deep and dark below them on their right,
were awful precipice and roaring torrent; tremendous mountains arose
in every vista.&nbsp; The gigantic landscape, uncheered by a touch of
changing light or a solitary ray of sun, was yet terribly distinct in
its ferocity.&nbsp; The hearts of two lonely men might shrink a little,
if they had to win their way for miles and hours among a legion of silent
and motionless men&mdash;mere men like themselves&mdash;all looking
at them with fixed and frowning front.&nbsp; But how much more, when
the legion is of Nature&rsquo;s mightiest works, and the frown may turn
to fury in an instant!</p>
<p>As they ascended, the road became gradually more rugged and difficult.&nbsp;
But the spirits of Vendale rose as they mounted higher, leaving so much
more of the road behind them conquered.&nbsp; Obenreizer spoke little,
and held on with a determined purpose.&nbsp; Both, in respect of agility
and endurance, were well qualified for the expedition.&nbsp; Whatever
the born mountaineer read in the weather-tokens that was illegible to
the other, he kept to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get across to-day?&rdquo; asked Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see how much
deeper the snow lies here than it lay half a league lower.&nbsp; The
higher we mount the deeper the snow will lie.&nbsp; Walking is half
wading even now.&nbsp; And the days are so short!&nbsp; If we get as
high as the fifth Refuge, and lie to-night at the Hospice, we shall
do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no danger of the weather rising in the night,&rdquo;
asked Vendale, anxiously, &ldquo;and snowing us up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is danger enough about us,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, with
a cautious glance onward and upward, &ldquo;to render silence our best
policy.&nbsp; You have heard of the Bridge of the Ganther?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have crossed it once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in the travelling season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it is another thing at this season;&rdquo; with a
sneer, as though he were out of temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is not a time
of year, or a state of things, on an Alpine Pass, that you gentlemen
holiday-travellers know much about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my Guide,&rdquo; said Vendale, good humouredly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I trust to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your Guide,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, &ldquo;and I will
guide you to your journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; There is the Bridge before
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had made a turn into a desolate and dismal ravine, where the
snow lay deep below them, deep above them, deep on every side.&nbsp;
While speaking, Obenreizer stood pointing at the Bridge, and observing
Vendale&rsquo;s face, with a very singular expression on his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I, as Guide, had sent you over there, in advance, and encouraged
you to give a shout or two, you might have brought down upon yourself
tons and tons and tons of snow, that would not only have struck you
dead, but buried you deep, at a blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt.&nbsp; But that is not what I have to do, as Guide.&nbsp;
So pass silently.&nbsp; Or, going as we go, our indiscretion might else
crush and bury <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Let us get on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a great accumulation of snow on the Bridge; and such enormous
accumulations of snow overhung them from protecting masses of rock,
that they might have been making their way through a stormy sky of white
clouds.&nbsp; Using his staff skilfully, sounding as he went, and looking
upward, with bent shoulders, as it were to resist the mere idea of a
fall from above, Obenreizer softly led.&nbsp; Vendale closely followed.&nbsp;
They were yet in the midst of their dangerous way, when there came a
mighty rush, followed by a sound as of thunder.&nbsp; Obenreizer clapped
his hand on Vendale&rsquo;s mouth and pointed to the track behind them.&nbsp;
Its aspect had been wholly changed in a moment.&nbsp; An avalanche had
swept over it, and plunged into the torrent at the bottom of the gulf
below.</p>
<p>Their appearance at the solitary Inn not far beyond this terrible
Bridge, elicited many expressions of astonishment from the people shut
up in the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;We stay but to rest,&rdquo; said Obenreizer,
shaking the snow from his dress at the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;This gentleman
has very pressing occasion to get across; tell them, Vendale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, I have very pressing occasion.&nbsp; I must cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear, all of you.&nbsp; My friend has very pressing occasion
to get across, and we want no advice and no help.&nbsp; I am as good
a guide, my fellow-countrymen, as any of you.&nbsp; Now, give us to
eat and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, and in nearly the same words, when it was
coming on dark and they had struggled through the greatly increased
difficulties of the road, and had at last reached their destination
for the night, Obenreizer said to the astonished people of the Hospice,
gathering about them at the fire, while they were yet in the act of
getting their wet shoes off, and shaking the snow from their clothes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well to understand one another, friends all.&nbsp; This
gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Has,&rdquo; said Vendale, readily taking him up with
a smile, &ldquo;very pressing occasion to get across.&nbsp; Must cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear?&mdash;has very pressing occasion to get across,
must cross.&nbsp; We want no advice and no help.&nbsp; I am mountain-born,
and act as Guide.&nbsp; Do not worry us by talking about it, but let
us have supper, and wine, and bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All through the intense cold of the night, the same awful stillness.&nbsp;
Again at sunrise, no sunny tinge to gild or redden the snow.&nbsp; The
same interminable waste of deathly white; the same immovable air; the
same monotonous gloom in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travellers!&rdquo; a friendly voice called to them from the
door, after they were afoot, knapsack on back and staff in hand, as
yesterday; &ldquo;recollect!&nbsp; There are five places of shelter,
near together, on the dangerous road before you; and there is the wooden
cross, and there is the next Hospice.&nbsp; Do not stray from the track.&nbsp;
If the <i>Tourmente</i> comes on, take shelter instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trade of these poor devils!&rdquo; said Obenreizer to
his friend, with a contemptuous backward wave of his hand towards the
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;How they stick to their trade!&nbsp; You Englishmen
say we Swiss are mercenary.&nbsp; Truly, it does look like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had divided between the two knapsacks such refreshments as they
had been able to obtain that morning, and as they deemed it prudent
to take.&nbsp; Obenreizer carried the wine as his share of the burden;
Vendale, the bread and meat and cheese, and the flask of brandy.</p>
<p>They had for some time laboured upward and onward through the snow&mdash;which
was now above their knees in the track, and of unknown depth elsewhere&mdash;and
they were still labouring upward and onward through the most frightful
part of that tremendous desolation, when snow begin to fall.&nbsp; At
first, but a few flakes descended slowly and steadily.&nbsp; After a
little while the fall grew much denser, and suddenly it began without
apparent cause to whirl itself into spiral shapes.&nbsp; Instantly ensuing
upon this last change, an icy blast came roaring at them, and every
sound and force imprisoned until now was let loose.</p>
<p>One of the dismal galleries through which the road is carried at
that perilous point, a cave eked out by arches of great strength, was
near at hand.&nbsp; They struggled into it, and the storm raged wildly.&nbsp;
The noise of the wind, the noise of the water, the thundering down of
displaced masses of rock and snow, the awful voices with which not only
that gorge but every gorge in the whole monstrous range seemed to be
suddenly endowed, the darkness as of night, the violent revolving of
the snow which beat and broke it into spray and blinded them, the madness
of everything around insatiate for destruction, the rapid substitution
of furious violence for unnatural calm, and hosts of appalling sounds
for silence: these were things, on the edge of a deep abyss, to chill
the blood, though the fierce wind, made actually solid by ice and snow,
had failed to chill it.</p>
<p>Obenreizer, walking to and fro in the gallery without ceasing, signed
to Vendale to help him unbuckle his knapsack.&nbsp; They could see each
other, but could not have heard each other speak.&nbsp; Vendale complying,
Obenreizer produced his bottle of wine, and poured some out, motioning
Vendale to take that for warmth&rsquo;s sake, and not brandy.&nbsp;
Vendale again complying, Obenreizer seemed to drink after him, and the
two walked backwards and forwards side by side; both well knowing that
to rest or sleep would be to die.</p>
<p>The snow came driving heavily into the gallery by the upper end at
which they would pass out of it, if they ever passed out; for greater
dangers lay on the road behind them than before.&nbsp; The snow soon
began to choke the arch.&nbsp; An hour more, and it lay so high as to
block out half the returning daylight.&nbsp; But it froze hard now,
as it fell, and could be clambered through or over.&nbsp; The violence
of the mountain storm was gradually yielding to steady snowfall.&nbsp;
The wind still raged at intervals, but not incessantly; and when it
paused, the snow fell in heavy flakes.</p>
<p>They might have been two hours in their frightful prison, when Obenreizer,
now crunching into the mound, now creeping over it with his head bowed
down and his body touching the top of the arch, made his way out.&nbsp;
Vendale followed close upon him, but followed without clear motive or
calculation.&nbsp; For the lethargy of Basle was creeping over him again,
and mastering his senses.</p>
<p>How far he had followed out of the gallery, or with what obstacles
he had since contended, he knew not.&nbsp; He became roused to the knowledge
that Obenreizer had set upon him, and that they were struggling desperately
in the snow.&nbsp; He became roused to the remembrance of what his assailant
carried in a girdle.&nbsp; He felt for it, drew it, struck at him, struggled
again, struck at him again, cast him off, and stood face to face with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to guide you to your journey&rsquo;s end,&rdquo;
said Obenreizer, &ldquo;and I have kept my promise.&nbsp; The journey
of your life ends here.&nbsp; Nothing can prolong it.&nbsp; You are
sleeping as you stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a villain.&nbsp; What have you done to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a fool.&nbsp; I have drugged you.&nbsp; You are doubly
a fool, for I drugged you once before upon the journey, to try you.&nbsp;
You are trebly a fool, for I am the thief and forger, and in a few moments
I shall take those proofs against the thief and forger from your insensible
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entrapped man tried to throw off the lethargy, but its fatal
hold upon him was so sure that, even while he heard those words, he
stupidly wondered which of them had been wounded, and whose blood it
was that he saw sprinkled on the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done to you,&rdquo; he asked, heavily and thickly,
&ldquo;that you should be&mdash;so base&mdash;a murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done to me?&nbsp; You would have destroyed me, but that you
have come to your journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Your cursed activity interposed
between me, and the time I had counted on in which I might have replaced
the money.&nbsp; Done to me?&nbsp; You have come in my way&mdash;not
once, not twice, but again and again and again.&nbsp; Did I try to shake
you off in the beginning, or no?&nbsp; You were not to be shaken off.&nbsp;
Therefore you die here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale tried to think coherently, tried to speak coherently, tried
to pick up the iron-shod staff he had let fall; failing to touch it,
tried to stagger on without its aid.&nbsp; All in vain, all in vain!&nbsp;
He stumbled, and fell heavily forward on the brink of the deep chasm.</p>
<p>Stupefied, dozing, unable to stand upon his feet, a veil before his
eyes, his sense of hearing deadened, he made such a vigorous rally that,
supporting himself on his hands, he saw his enemy standing calmly over
him, and heard him speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;You call me murderer,&rdquo;
said Obenreizer, with a grim laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;The name matters very
little.&nbsp; But at least I have set my life against yours, for I am
surrounded by dangers, and may never make my way out of this place.&nbsp;
The <i>Tourmente</i> is rising again.&nbsp; The snow is on the whirl.&nbsp;
I must have the papers now.&nbsp; Every moment has my life in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Vendale, in a terrible voice, staggering
up with a last flash of fire breaking out of him, and clutching the
thievish hands at his breast, in both of his.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop!&nbsp;
Stand away from me!&nbsp; God bless my Marguerite!&nbsp; Happily she
will never know how I died.&nbsp; Stand off from me, and let me look
at your murderous face.&nbsp; Let it remind me&mdash;of something&mdash;left
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of him fighting so hard for his senses, and the doubt whether
he might not for the instant be possessed by the strength of a dozen
men, kept his opponent still.&nbsp; Wildly glaring at him, Vendale faltered
out the broken words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall not be&mdash;the trust&mdash;of the dead&mdash;betrayed
by me&mdash;reputed parents&mdash;misinherited fortune&mdash;see to
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his head dropped on his breast, and he stumbled on the brink of
the chasm as before, the thievish hands went once more, quick and busy,
to his breast.&nbsp; He made a convulsive attempt to cry &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
desperately rolled himself over into the gulf; and sank away from his
enemy&rsquo;s touch, like a phantom in a dreadful dream.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The mountain storm raged again, and passed again.&nbsp; The awful
mountain-voices died away, the moon rose, and the soft and silent snow
fell.</p>
<p>Two men and two large dogs came out at the door of the Hospice.&nbsp;
The men looked carefully around them, and up at the sky.&nbsp; The dogs
rolled in the snow, and took it into their mouths, and cast it up with
their paws.</p>
<p>One of the men said to the other: &ldquo;We may venture now.&nbsp;
We may find them in one of the five Refuges.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each fastened
on his back a basket; each took in his hand a strong spiked pole; each
girded under his arms a looped end of a stout rope, so that they were
tied together.</p>
<p>Suddenly the dogs desisted from their gambols in the snow, stood
looking down the ascent, put their noses up, put their noses down, became
greatly excited, and broke into a deep loud bay together.</p>
<p>The two men looked in the faces of the two dogs.&nbsp; The two dogs
looked, with at least equal intelligence, in the faces of the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Au secours, then!&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; To the rescue!&rdquo;
cried the two men.&nbsp; The two dogs, with a glad, deep, generous bark,
bounded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more mad ones!&rdquo; said the men, stricken motionless,
and looking away in the moonlight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it possible in such
weather!&nbsp; And one of them a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the dogs had the corner of a woman&rsquo;s dress in its mouth,
and drew her along.&nbsp; She fondled their heads as she came up, and
she came up through the snow with an accustomed tread.&nbsp; Not so
the large man with her, who was spent and winded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear guides, dear friends of travellers!&nbsp; I am of your
country.&nbsp; We seek two gentlemen crossing the Pass, who should have
reached the Hospice this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have reached it, ma&rsquo;amselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&nbsp; O thank Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, unhappily, they have gone on again.&nbsp; We are setting
forth to seek them even now.&nbsp; We had to wait until the <i>Tourmente</i>
passed.&nbsp; It has been fearful up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear guides, dear friends of travellers!&nbsp; Let me go with
you.&nbsp; Let me go with you for the love of GOD!&nbsp; One of those
gentlemen is to be my husband.&nbsp; I love him, O, so dearly.&nbsp;
O so dearly!&nbsp; You see I am not faint, you see I am not tired.&nbsp;
I am born a peasant girl.&nbsp; I will show you that I know well how
to fasten myself to your ropes.&nbsp; I will do it with my own hands.&nbsp;
I will swear to be brave and good.&nbsp; But let me go with you, let
me go with you!&nbsp; If any mischance should have befallen him, my
love would find him, when nothing else could.&nbsp; On my knees, dear
friends of travellers!&nbsp; By the love your dear mothers had for your
fathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good rough fellows were moved.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all,&rdquo;
they murmured to one another, &ldquo;she speaks but the truth.&nbsp;
She knows the ways of the mountains.&nbsp; See how marvellously she
has come here.&nbsp; But as to Monsieur there, ma&rsquo;amselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Joey,&rdquo; said Marguerite, addressing him in his
own tongue, &ldquo;you will remain at the house, and wait for me; will
you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know&rsquo;d which o&rsquo; you two recommended it,&rdquo;
growled Joey Ladle, eyeing the two men with great indignation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
fight you for sixpence, and give you half-a-crown towards your expenses.&nbsp;
No, Miss.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stick by you as long as there&rsquo;s any
sticking left in me, and I&rsquo;ll die for you when I can&rsquo;t do
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The state of the moon rendering it highly important that no time
should be lost, and the dogs showing signs of great uneasiness, the
two men quickly took their resolution.&nbsp; The rope that yoked them
together was exchanged for a longer one; the party were secured, Marguerite
second, and the Cellarman last; and they set out for the Refuges.&nbsp;
The actual distance of those places was nothing: the whole five, and
the next Hospice to boot, being within two miles; but the ghastly way
was whitened out and sheeted over.</p>
<p>They made no miss in reaching the Gallery where the two had taken
shelter.&nbsp; The second storm of wind and snow had so wildly swept
over it since, that their tracks were gone.&nbsp; But the dogs went
to and fro with their noses down, and were confident.&nbsp; The party
stopping, however, at the further arch, where the second storm had been
especially furious, and where the drift was deep, the dogs became troubled,
and went about and about, in quest of a lost purpose.</p>
<p>The great abyss being known to lie on the right, they wandered too
much to the left, and had to regain the way with infinite labour through
a deep field of snow.&nbsp; The leader of the line had stopped it, and
was taking note of the landmarks, when one of the dogs fell to tearing
up the snow a little before them.&nbsp; Advancing and stooping to look
at it, thinking that some one might be overwhelmed there, they saw that
it was stained, and that the stain was red.</p>
<p>The other dog was now seen to look over the brink of the gulf, with
his fore legs straightened out, lest he should fall into it, and to
tremble in every limb.&nbsp; Then the dog who had found the stained
snow joined him, and then they ran to and fro, distressed and whining.&nbsp;
Finally, they both stopped on the brink together, and setting up their
heads, howled dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some one lying below,&rdquo; said Marguerite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said the foremost man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand
well inward, the two last, and let us look over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last man kindled two torches from his basket, and handed them
forward.&nbsp; The leader taking one, and Marguerite the other, they
looked down; now shading the torches, now moving them to the right or
left, now raising them, now depressing them, as moonlight far below
contended with black shadows.&nbsp; A piercing cry from Marguerite broke
a long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&nbsp; On a projecting point, where a wall of ice stretches
forward over the torrent, I see a human form!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, ma&rsquo;amselle, where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, there!&nbsp; On the shelf of ice below the dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader, with a sickened aspect, drew inward, and they were all
silent.&nbsp; But they were not all inactive, for Marguerite, with swift
and skilful fingers, had detached both herself and him from the rope
in a few seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me the baskets.&nbsp; These two are the only ropes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only ropes here, ma&rsquo;amselle; but at the Hospice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is alive&mdash;I know it is my lover&mdash;he will be
dead before you can return.&nbsp; Dear Guides!&nbsp; Blessed friends
of travellers!&nbsp; Look at me.&nbsp; Watch my hands.&nbsp; If they
falter or go wrong, make me your prisoner by force.&nbsp; If they are
steady and go right, help me to save him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She girded herself with a cord under the breast and arms, she formed
it into a kind of jacket, she drew it into knots, she laid its end side
by side with the end of the other cord, she twisted and twined the two
together, she knotted them together, she set her foot upon the knots,
she strained them, she held them for the two men to strain at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is inspired,&rdquo; they said to one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Almighty&rsquo;s mercy!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You both know that I am by far the lightest here.&nbsp; Give
me the brandy and the wine, and lower me down to him.&nbsp; Then go
for assistance and a stronger rope.&nbsp; You see that when it is lowered
to me&mdash;look at this about me now&mdash;I can make it fast and safe
to his body.&nbsp; Alive or dead, I will bring him up, or die with him.&nbsp;
I love him passionately.&nbsp; Can I say more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned to her companion, but he was lying senseless on the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower me down to him,&rdquo; she said, taking two little kegs
they had brought, and hanging them about her, &ldquo;or I will dash
myself to pieces!&nbsp; I am a peasant, and I know no giddiness or fear;
and this is nothing to me, and I passionately love him.&nbsp; Lower
me down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;amselle, ma&rsquo;amselle, he must be dying or dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying or dead, my husband&rsquo;s head shall lie upon my breast,
or I will dash myself to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They yielded, overborne.&nbsp; With such precautions as their skill
and the circumstances admitted, they let her slip from the summit, guiding
herself down the precipitous icy wall with her hand, and they lowered
down, and lowered down, and lowered down, until the cry came up: &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really he, and is he dead?&rdquo; they called down,
looking over.</p>
<p>The cry came up: &ldquo;He is insensible; but his heart beats.&nbsp;
It beats against mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry came up: &ldquo;Upon a ledge of ice.&nbsp; It has thawed
beneath him, and it will thaw beneath me.&nbsp; Hasten.&nbsp; If we
die, I am content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the two men hurried off with the dogs at such topmost speed
as he could make; the other set up the lighted torches in the snow,
and applied himself to recovering the Englishman.&nbsp; Much snow-chafing
and some brandy got him on his legs, but delirious and quite unconscious
where he was.</p>
<p>The watch remained upon the brink, and his cry went down continually:
&ldquo;Courage!&nbsp; They will soon be here.&nbsp; How goes it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the cry came up: &ldquo;His heart still beats against mine.&nbsp;
I warm him in my arms.&nbsp; I have cast off the rope, for the ice melts
under us, and the rope would separate me from him; but I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon went down behind the mountain tops, and all the abyss lay
in darkness.&nbsp; The cry went down: &ldquo;How goes it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The cry came up: &ldquo;We are sinking lower, but his heart still beats
against mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the eager barking of the dogs, and a flare of light upon
the snow, proclaimed that help was coming on.&nbsp; Twenty or thirty
men, lamps, torches, litters, ropes, blankets, wood to kindle a great
fire, restoratives and stimulants, came in fast.&nbsp; The dogs ran
from one man to another, and from this thing to that, and ran to the
edge of the abyss, dumbly entreating Speed, speed, speed!</p>
<p>The cry went down: &ldquo;Thanks to God, all is ready.&nbsp; How
goes it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry came up: &ldquo;We are sinking still, and we are deadly cold.&nbsp;
His heart no longer beats against mine.&nbsp; Let no one come down,
to add to our weight.&nbsp; Lower the rope only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire was kindled high, a great glare of torches lighted the sides
of the precipice, lamps were lowered, a strong rope was lowered.&nbsp;
She could be seen passing it round him, and making it secure.</p>
<p>The cry came up into a deathly silence: &ldquo;Raise!&nbsp; Softly!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They could see her diminished figure shrink, as he was swung into the
air.</p>
<p>They gave no shout when some of them laid him on a litter, and others
lowered another strong rope.&nbsp; The cry again came up into a deathly
silence: &ldquo;Raise!&nbsp; Softly!&rdquo;&nbsp; But when they caught
her at the brink, then they shouted, then they wept, then they gave
thanks to Heaven, then they kissed her feet, then they kissed her dress,
then the dogs caressed her, licked her icy hands, and with their honest
faces warmed her frozen bosom!</p>
<p>She broke from them all, and sank over him on his litter, with both
her loving hands upon the heart that stood still.</p>
<h2>ACT IV.</h2>
<h3>THE CLOCK-LOCK</h3>
<p>The pleasant scene was Neuch&acirc;tel; the pleasant month was April;
the pleasant place was a notary&rsquo;s office; the pleasant person
in it was the notary: a rosy, hearty, handsome old man, chief notary
of Neuch&acirc;tel, known far and wide in the canton as Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt.&nbsp; Professionally and personally, the notary was a popular
citizen.&nbsp; His innumerable kindnesses and his innumerable oddities
had for years made him one of the recognised public characters of the
pleasant Swiss town.&nbsp; His long brown frock-coat and his black skull-cap,
were among the institutions of the place: and he carried a snuff-box
which, in point of size, was popularly believed to be without a parallel
in Europe.</p>
<p>There was another person in the notary&rsquo;s office, not so pleasant
as the notary.&nbsp; This was Obenreizer.</p>
<p>An oddly pastoral kind of office it was, and one that would never
have answered in England.&nbsp; It stood in a neat back yard, fenced
off from a pretty flower-garden.&nbsp; Goats browsed in the doorway,
and a cow was within half-a-dozen feet of keeping company with the clerk.&nbsp;
Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&rsquo;s room was a bright and varnished little room,
with panelled walls, like a toy-chamber.&nbsp; According to the seasons
of the year, roses, sunflowers, hollyhocks, peeped in at the windows.&nbsp;
Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&rsquo;s bees hummed through the office all the summer,
in at this window and out at that, taking it frequently in their day&rsquo;s
work, as if honey were to be made from Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&rsquo;s sweet
disposition.&nbsp; A large musical box on the chimney-piece often trilled
away at the Overture to Fra Diavolo, or a Selection from William Tell,
with a chirruping liveliness that had to be stopped by force on the
entrance of a client, and irrepressibly broke out again the moment his
back was turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, courage, my good fellow!&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt, patting Obenreizer on the knee, in a fatherly and comforting
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will begin a new life to-morrow morning in my
office here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer&mdash;dressed in mourning, and subdued in manner&mdash;lifted
his hand, with a white handkerchief in it, to the region of his heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The gratitude is here,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the words
to express it are not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ta-ta-ta!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk to me about gratitude!&rdquo;
said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate to see a man oppressed.&nbsp;
I see you oppressed, and I hold out my hand to you by instinct.&nbsp;
Besides, I am not too old yet, to remember my young days.&nbsp; Your
father sent me my first client.&nbsp; (It was on a question of half
an acre of vineyard that seldom bore any grapes.)&nbsp; Do I owe nothing
to your father&rsquo;s son?&nbsp; I owe him a debt of friendly obligation,
and I pay it to you.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s rather neatly expressed, I think,&rdquo;
added Ma&icirc;tre Voigt, in high good humour with himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Permit
me to reward my own merit with a pinch of snuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer dropped his eyes to the ground, as though he were not
even worthy to see the notary take snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do me one last favour, sir,&rdquo; he said, when he raised
his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not act on impulse.&nbsp; Thus far, you have
only a general knowledge of my position.&nbsp; Hear the case for and
against me, in its details, before you take me into your office.&nbsp;
Let my claim on your benevolence be recognised by your sound reason
as well as by your excellent heart.&nbsp; In <i>that</i> case, I may
hold up my head against the bitterest of my enemies, and build myself
a new reputation on the ruins of the character I have lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
speak well, my son.&nbsp; You will be a fine lawyer one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The details are not many,&rdquo; pursued Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My troubles begin with the accidental death of my late travelling
companion, my lost dear friend Mr. Vendale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vendale,&rdquo; repeated the notary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
so.&nbsp; I have heard and read of the name, several times within these
two months.&nbsp; The name of the unfortunate English gentleman who
was killed on the Simplon.&nbsp; When you got that scar upon your cheek
and neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;From my own knife,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, touching
what must have been an ugly gash at the time of its infliction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your own knife,&rdquo; assented the notary, &ldquo;and
in trying to save him.&nbsp; Good, good, good.&nbsp; That was very good.&nbsp;
Vendale.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I have several times, lately, thought it droll
that I should once have had a client of that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the world, sir,&rdquo; returned Obenreizer, &ldquo;is
<i>so</i> small!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless he made a mental note that
the notary had once had a client of that name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying, sir, the death of that dear travelling comrade
begins my troubles.&nbsp; What follows?&nbsp; I save myself.&nbsp; I
go down to Milan.&nbsp; I am received with coldness by Defresnier and
Company.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, I am discharged by Defresnier and
Company.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; They give no reason why.&nbsp; I ask, do they
assail my honour?&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; I ask, what is the imputation
against me?&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; I ask, where are their proofs against
me?&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; I ask, what am I to think?&nbsp; The reply
is, &lsquo;M. Obenreizer is free to think what he will.&nbsp; What M.
Obenreizer thinks, is of no importance to Defresnier and Company.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; That is all,&rdquo; asserted the notary,
taking a large pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is that enough, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not enough,&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The House of Defresnier are my fellow townsmen&mdash;much respected,
much esteemed&mdash;but the House of Defresnier must not silently destroy
a man&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; You can rebut assertion.&nbsp; But how
can you rebut silence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sense of justice, my dear patron,&rdquo; answered Obenreizer,
&ldquo;states in a word the cruelty of the case.&nbsp; Does it stop
there?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; For, what follows upon that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my poor boy,&rdquo; said the notary, with a comforting
nod or two; &ldquo;your ward rebels upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebels is too soft a word,&rdquo; retorted Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My ward revolts from me with horror.&nbsp; My ward defies me.&nbsp;
My ward withdraws herself from my authority, and takes shelter (Madame
Dor with her) in the house of that English lawyer, Mr. Bintrey, who
replies to your summons to her to submit herself to my authority, that
she will not do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And who afterwards writes,&rdquo; said the notary,
moving his large snuff-box to look among the papers underneath it for
the letter, &ldquo;that he is coming to confer with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; replied Obenreizer, rather checked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
sir.&nbsp; Have I no legal rights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, my poor boy,&rdquo; returned the notary.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All but felons have their legal rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who calls me felon?&rdquo; said Obenreizer, fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one.&nbsp; Be calm under your wrongs.&nbsp; If the House
of Defresnier would call you felon, indeed, we should know how to deal
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While saying these words, he had handed Bintrey&rsquo;s very short
letter to Obenreizer, who now read it and gave it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In saying,&rdquo; observed Obenreizer, with recovered composure,
&ldquo;that he is coming to confer with you, this English lawyer means
that he is coming to deny my authority over my ward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&nbsp; I know him.&nbsp; He is obstinate and
contentious.&nbsp; You will tell me, my dear sir, whether my authority
is unassailable, until my ward is of age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely unassailable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will enforce it.&nbsp; I will make her submit herself to
it.&nbsp; For,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, changing his angry tone to one
of grateful submission, &ldquo;I owe it to you, sir; to you, who have
so confidingly taken an injured man under your protection, and into
your employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your mind easy,&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No more of this now, and no thanks!&nbsp; Be here to-morrow morning,
before the other clerk comes&mdash;between seven and eight.&nbsp; You
will find me in this room; and I will myself initiate you in your work.&nbsp;
Go away! go away!&nbsp; I have letters to write.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
hear a word more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismissed with this generous abruptness, and satisfied with the favourable
impression he had left on the old man&rsquo;s mind, Obenreizer was at
leisure to revert to the mental note he had made that Ma&icirc;tre Voigt
once had a client whose name was Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know England well enough by this time;&rdquo; so
his meditations ran, as he sat on a bench in the yard; &ldquo;and it
is not a name I ever encountered there, except&mdash;&rdquo; he looked
involuntarily over his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;as <i>his</i> name.&nbsp;
Is the world so small that I cannot get away from him, even now when
he is dead?&nbsp; He confessed at the last that he had betrayed the
trust of the dead, and misinherited a fortune.&nbsp; And I was to see
to it.&nbsp; And I was to stand off, that my face might remind him of
it.&nbsp; Why <i>my</i> face, unless it concerned <i>me</i>?&nbsp; I
am sure of his words, for they have been in my ears ever since.&nbsp;
Can there be anything bearing on them, in the keeping of this old idiot?&nbsp;
Anything to repair my fortunes, and blacken his memory?&nbsp; He dwelt
upon my earliest remembrances, that night at Basle.&nbsp; Why, unless
he had a purpose in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&rsquo;s two largest he-goats were butting at him
to butt him out of the place, as if for that disrespectful mention of
their master.&nbsp; So he got up and left the place.&nbsp; But he walked
alone for a long time on the border of the lake, with his head drooped
in deep thought.</p>
<p>Between seven and eight next morning, he presented himself again
at the office.&nbsp; He found the notary ready for him, at work on some
papers which had come in on the previous evening.&nbsp; In a few clear
words, Ma&icirc;tre Voigt explained the routine of the office, and the
duties Obenreizer would be expected to perform.&nbsp; It still wanted
five minutes to eight, when the preliminary instructions were declared
to be complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you over the house and the offices,&rdquo; said
Ma&icirc;tre Voigt, &ldquo;but I must put away these papers first.&nbsp;
They come from the municipal authorities, and they must be taken special
care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer saw his chance, here, of finding out the repository in
which his employer&rsquo;s private papers were kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I save you the trouble, sir?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I put those documents away under your directions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma&icirc;tre Voigt laughed softly to himself; closed the portfolio
in which the papers had been sent to him; handed it to Obenreizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you try,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;All my papers
of importance are kept yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a heavy oaken door, thickly studded with nails, at
the lower end of the room.&nbsp; Approaching the door, with the portfolio,
Obenreizer discovered, to his astonishment, that there were no means
whatever of opening it from the outside.&nbsp; There was no handle,
no bolt, no key, and (climax of passive obstruction!) no keyhole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a second door to this room?&rdquo; said Obenreizer,
appealing to the notary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Guess again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort.&nbsp; The window has been bricked up.&nbsp;
The only way in, is the way by that door.&nbsp; Do you give it up?&rdquo;
cried Ma&icirc;tre Voigt, in high triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen, my good
fellow, and tell me if you hear nothing inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer listened for a moment, and started back from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard of this
when I was apprenticed here at the watchmaker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Perrin
Brothers have finished their famous clock-lock at last&mdash;and you
have got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;The clock-lock
it is!&nbsp; There, my son!&nbsp; There you have one more of what the
good people of this town call, &lsquo;Daddy Voigt&rsquo;s follies.&rsquo;&nbsp;
With all my heart!&nbsp; Let those laugh who win.&nbsp; No thief can
steal <i>my</i> keys.&nbsp; No burglar can pick <i>my</i> lock.&nbsp;
No power on earth, short of a battering-ram or a barrel of gunpowder,
can move that door, till my little sentinel inside&mdash;my worthy friend
who goes &lsquo;Tick, Tick,&rsquo; as I tell him&mdash;says, &lsquo;Open!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The big door obeys the little Tick, Tick, and the little Tick, Tick,
obeys <i>me</i>.&nbsp; That!&rdquo; cried Daddy Voigt, snapping his
fingers, &ldquo;for all the thieves in Christendom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see it in action?&rdquo; asked Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pardon
my curiosity, dear sir!&nbsp; You know that I was once a tolerable worker
in the clock trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you shall see it in action,&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the time now?&nbsp; One minute to eight.&nbsp;
Watch, and in one minute you will see the door open of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one minute, smoothly and slowly and silently, as if invisible
hands had set it free, the heavy door opened inward, and disclosed a
dark chamber beyond.&nbsp; On three sides, shelves filled the walls,
from floor to ceiling.&nbsp; Arranged on the shelves, were rows upon
rows of boxes made in the pretty inlaid woodwork of Switzerland, and
bearing inscribed on their fronts (for the most part in fanciful coloured
letters) the names of the notary&rsquo;s clients.</p>
<p>Ma&icirc;tre Voigt lighted a taper, and led the way into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see the clock,&rdquo; he said proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
possess the greatest curiosity in Europe.&nbsp; It is only a privileged
few whose eyes can look at it.&nbsp; I give the privilege to your good
father&rsquo;s son&mdash;you shall be one of the favoured few who enter
the room with me.&nbsp; See! here it is, on the right-hand wall at the
side of the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ordinary clock,&rdquo; exclaimed Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&nbsp;
Not an ordinary clock.&nbsp; It has only one hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not an ordinary
clock, my friend.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; That one hand goes round the dial.&nbsp;
As I put it, so it regulates the hour at which the door shall open.&nbsp;
See!&nbsp; The hand points to eight.&nbsp; At eight the door opened,
as you saw for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it open more than once in the four-and-twenty hours?&rdquo;
asked Obenreizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than once?&rdquo; repeated the notary, with great scorn.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my good friend, Tick-Tick!&nbsp; He will
open the door as often as I ask him.&nbsp; All he wants is his directions,
and he gets them here.&nbsp; Look below the dial.&nbsp; Here is a half-circle
of steel let into the wall, and here is a hand (called the regulator)
that travels round it, just as <i>my</i> hand chooses.&nbsp; Notice,
if you please, that there are figures to guide me on the half-circle
of steel.&nbsp; Figure I. means: Open once in the four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp;
Figure II. means: Open twice; and so on to the end.&nbsp; I set the
regulator every morning, after I have read my letters, and when I know
what my day&rsquo;s work is to be.&nbsp; Would you like to see me set
it now?&nbsp; What is to-day?&nbsp; Wednesday.&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; This
is the day of our rifle-club; there is little business to do; I grant
a half-holiday.&nbsp; No work here to-day, after three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
Let us first put away this portfolio of municipal papers.&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
No need to trouble Tick-Tick to open the door until eight to-morrow.&nbsp;
Good!&nbsp; I leave the dial-hand at eight; I put back the regulator
to I.; I close the door; and closed the door remains, past all opening
by anybody, till to-morrow morning at eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer&rsquo;s quickness instantly saw the means by which he
might make the clock-lock betray its master&rsquo;s confidence, and
place its master&rsquo;s papers at his disposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, sir!&rdquo; he cried, at the moment when the notary
was closing the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I see something moving
among the boxes&mdash;on the floor there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Ma&icirc;tre Voigt turned his back for a moment to look.&nbsp; In
that moment, Obenreizer&rsquo;s ready hand put the regulator on, from
the figure &ldquo;I.&rdquo; to the figure &ldquo;II.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unless
the notary looked again at the half-circle of steel, the door would
open at eight that evening, as well as at eight next morning, and nobody
but Obenreizer would know it.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing!&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
troubles have shaken your nerves, my son.&nbsp; Some shadow thrown by
my taper; or some poor little beetle, who lives among the old lawyer&rsquo;s
secrets, running away from the light.&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; I hear your
fellow-clerk in the office.&nbsp; To work! to work! and build to-day
the first step that leads to your new fortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He good-humouredly pushed Obenreizer out before him; extinguished
the taper, with a last fond glance at his clock which passed harmlessly
over the regulator beneath; and closed the oaken door.</p>
<p>At three, the office was shut up.&nbsp; The notary and everybody
in the notary&rsquo;s employment, with one exception, went to see the
rifle-shooting.&nbsp; Obenreizer had pleaded that he was not in spirits
for a public festival.&nbsp; Nobody knew what had become of him.&nbsp;
It was believed that he had slipped away for a solitary walk.</p>
<p>The house and offices had been closed but a few minutes, when the
door of a shining wardrobe in the notary&rsquo;s shining room opened,
and Obenreizer stopped out.&nbsp; He walked to a window, unclosed the
shutters, satisfied himself that he could escape unseen by way of the
garden, turned back into the room, and took his place in the notary&rsquo;s
easy-chair.&nbsp; He was locked up in the house, and there were five
hours to wait before eight o&rsquo;clock came.</p>
<p>He wore his way through the five hours: sometimes reading the books
and newspapers that lay on the table: sometimes thinking: sometimes
walking to and fro.&nbsp; Sunset came on.&nbsp; He closed the window-shutters
before he kindled a light.&nbsp; The candle lighted, and the time drawing
nearer and nearer, he sat, watch in hand, with his eyes on the oaken
door.</p>
<p>At eight, smoothly and softly and silently the door opened.</p>
<p>One after another, he read the names on the outer rows of boxes.&nbsp;
No such name as Vendale!&nbsp; He removed the outer row, and looked
at the row behind.&nbsp; These were older boxes, and shabbier boxes.&nbsp;
The four first that he examined, were inscribed with French and German
names.&nbsp; The fifth bore a name which was almost illegible.&nbsp;
He brought it out into the room, and examined it closely.&nbsp; There,
covered thickly with time-stains and dust, was the name: &ldquo;Vendale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key hung to the box by a string.&nbsp; He unlocked the box, took
out four loose papers that were in it, spread them open on the table,
and began to read them.&nbsp; He had not so occupied a minute, when
his face fell from its expression of eagerness and avidity, to one of
haggard astonishment and disappointment.&nbsp; But, after a little consideration,
he copied the papers.&nbsp; He then replaced the papers, replaced the
box, closed the door, extinguished the candle, and stole away.</p>
<p>As his murderous and thievish footfall passed out of the garden,
the steps of the notary and some one accompanying him stopped at the
front door of the house.&nbsp; The lamps were lighted in the little
street, and the notary had his door-key in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not pass my house, Mr. Bintrey,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do me the honour to come in.&nbsp; It is one of our town half-holidays&mdash;our
Tir&mdash;but my people will be back directly.&nbsp; It is droll that
you should ask your way to the Hotel of me.&nbsp; Let us eat and drink
before you go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; not to-night,&rdquo; said Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall
I come to you at ten to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be enchanted, sir, to take so early an opportunity
of redressing the wrongs of my injured client,&rdquo; returned the good
notary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Bintrey; &ldquo;your injured client is
all very well&mdash;but&mdash;a word in your ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whispered to the notary and walked off.&nbsp; When the notary&rsquo;s
housekeeper came home, she found him standing at his door motionless,
with the key still in his hand, and the door unopened.</p>
<h3>OBENREIZER&rsquo;S VICTORY</h3>
<p>The scene shifts again&mdash;to the foot of the Simplon, on the Swiss
side.</p>
<p>In one of the dreary rooms of the dreary little inn at Brieg, Mr.
Bintrey and Ma&icirc;tre Voigt sat together at a professional council
of two.&nbsp; Mr. Bintrey was searching in his despatch-box.&nbsp; Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt was looking towards a closed door, painted brown to imitate mahogany,
and communicating with an inner room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time he was here?&rdquo; asked the notary,
shifting his position, and glancing at a second door at the other end
of the room, painted yellow to imitate deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> here,&rdquo; answered Bintrey, after listening
for a moment.</p>
<p>The yellow door was opened by a waiter, and Obenreizer walked in.</p>
<p>After greeting Ma&icirc;tre Voigt with a cordiality which appeared
to cause the notary no little embarrassment, Obenreizer bowed with grave
and distant politeness to Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;For what reason have
I been brought from Neuch&acirc;tel to the foot of the mountain?&rdquo;
he inquired, taking the seat which the English lawyer had indicated
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be quite satisfied on that head before our interview
is over,&rdquo; returned Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the present, permit
me to suggest proceeding at once to business.&nbsp; There has been a
correspondence, Mr. Obenreizer, between you and your niece.&nbsp; I
am here to represent your niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, you, a lawyer, are here to represent an infraction
of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirably put!&rdquo; said Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;If all the
people I have to deal with were only like you, what an easy profession
mine would be!&nbsp; I am here to represent an infraction of the law&mdash;that
is your point of view.&nbsp; I am here to make a compromise between
you and your niece&mdash;that is my point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be two parties to a compromise,&rdquo; rejoined
Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I decline, in this case, to be one of them.&nbsp;
The law gives me authority to control my niece&rsquo;s actions, until
she comes of age.&nbsp; She is not yet of age; and I claim my authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Ma&icirc;tre attempted to speak.&nbsp; Bintrey silenced
him with a compassionate indulgence of tone and manner, as if he was
silencing a favourite child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my worthy friend, not a word.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t excite
yourself unnecessarily; leave it to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned, and
addressed himself again to Obenreizer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can think of nothing
comparable to you, Mr. Obenreizer, but granite&mdash;and even that wears
out in course of time.&nbsp; In the interests of peace and quietness&mdash;for
the sake of your own dignity&mdash;relax a little.&nbsp; If you will
only delegate your authority to another person whom I know of, that
person may be trusted never to lose sight of your niece, night or day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wasting your time and mine,&rdquo; returned Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If my niece is not rendered up to my authority within one week
from this day, I invoke the law.&nbsp; If you resist the law, I take
her by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to his feet as he said the last word.&nbsp; Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt looked round again towards the brown door which led into the inner
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some pity on the poor girl,&rdquo; pleaded Bintrey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember how lately she lost her lover by a dreadful death!&nbsp;
Will nothing move you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bintrey, in his turn, rose to his feet, and looked at Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt.&nbsp; Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&rsquo;s hand, resting on the table,
began to tremble.&nbsp; Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed,
as if by irresistible fascination, on the brown door.&nbsp; Obenreizer,
suspiciously observing him, looked that way too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is somebody listening in there!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
with a sharp backward glance at Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two people listening,&rdquo; answered Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this answer, he raised his voice and spoke the next words&mdash;the
two common words which are on everybody&rsquo;s lips, at every hour
of the day: &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brown door opened.&nbsp; Supported on Marguerite&rsquo;s arm&mdash;his
sun-burnt colour gone, his right arm bandaged and clung over his breast&mdash;Vendale
stood before the murderer, a man risen from the dead.</p>
<p>In the moment of silence that followed, the singing of a caged bird
in the court-yard outside was the one sound stirring in the room.&nbsp;
Ma&icirc;tre Voigt touched Bintrey, and pointed to Obenreizer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look at him!&rdquo; said the notary, in a whisper.</p>
<p>The shock had paralysed every movement in the villain&rsquo;s body,
but the movement of the blood.&nbsp; His face was like the face of a
corpse.&nbsp; The one vestige of colour left in it was a livid purple
streak which marked the course of the scar where his victim had wounded
him on the cheek and neck.&nbsp; Speechless, breathless, motionless
alike in eye and limb, it seemed as if, at the sight of Vendale, the
death to which he had doomed Vendale had struck him where he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody ought to speak to him,&rdquo; said Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even at that moment Bintrey persisted in silencing the notary, and
in keeping the lead in the proceedings to himself.&nbsp; Checking Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt by a gesture, he dismissed Marguerite and Vendale in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;The
object of your appearance here is answered,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you will withdraw for the present, it may help Mr. Obenreizer to recover
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did help him.&nbsp; As the two passed through the door and closed
it behind them, he drew a deep breath of relief.&nbsp; He looked round
him for the chair from which he had risen, and dropped into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him time!&rdquo; pleaded Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
use he may make of it if I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned once more to Obenreizer,
and went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I owe it to myself,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t admit, mind, that I owe it to you&mdash;to account for my
appearance in these proceedings, and to state what has been done under
my advice, and on my sole responsibility.&nbsp; Can you listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recall the time when you started for Switzerland with Mr.
Vendale,&rdquo; Bintrey begin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had not left England
four-and-twenty hours before your niece committed an act of imprudence
which not even your penetration could foresee.&nbsp; She followed her
promised husband on his journey, without asking anybody&rsquo;s advice
or permission, and without any better companion to protect her than
a Cellarman in Mr. Vendale&rsquo;s employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she follow me on the journey? and how came the Cellarman
to be the person who accompanied her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She followed you on the journey,&rdquo; answered Bintrey,
&ldquo;because she suspected there had been some serious collision between
you and Mr. Vendale, which had been kept secret from her; and because
she rightly believed you to be capable of serving your interests, or
of satisfying your enmity, at the price of a crime.&nbsp; As for the
Cellarman, he was one, among the other people in Mr. Vendale&rsquo;s
establishment, to whom she had applied (the moment your back was turned)
to know if anything had happened between their master and you.&nbsp;
The Cellarman alone had something to tell her.&nbsp; A senseless superstition,
and a common accident which had happened to his master, in his master&rsquo;s
cellar, had connected Mr. Vendale in this man&rsquo;s mind with the
idea of danger by murder.&nbsp; Your niece surprised him into a confession,
which aggravated tenfold the terrors that possessed her.&nbsp; Aroused
to a sense of the mischief he had done, the man, of his own accord,
made the one atonement in his power.&nbsp; &lsquo;If my master is in
danger, miss,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s my duty to follow him,
too; and it&rsquo;s more than my duty to take care of <i>you</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The two set forth together&mdash;and, for once, a superstition has had
its use.&nbsp; It decided your niece on taking the journey; and it led
the way to saving a man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Do you understand me, so
far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you, so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first knowledge of the crime that you had committed,&rdquo;
pursued Bintrey, &ldquo;came to me in the form of a letter from your
niece.&nbsp; All you need know is that her love and her courage recovered
the body of your victim, and aided the after-efforts which brought him
back to life.&nbsp; While he lay helpless at Brieg, under her care,
she wrote to me to come out to him.&nbsp; Before starting, I informed
Madame Dor that I knew Miss Obenreizer to be safe, and knew where she
was.&nbsp; Madame Dor informed me, in return, that a letter had come
for your niece, which she knew to be in your handwriting.&nbsp; I took
possession of it, and arranged for the forwarding of any other letters
which might follow.&nbsp; Arrived at Brieg, I found Mr. Vendale out
of danger, and at once devoted myself to hastening the day of reckoning
with you.&nbsp; Defresnier and Company turned you off on suspicion;
acting on information privately supplied by me.&nbsp; Having stripped
you of your false character, the next thing to do was to strip you of
your authority over your niece.&nbsp; To reach this end, I not only
had no scruple in digging the pitfall under your feet in the dark&mdash;I
felt a certain professional pleasure in fighting you with your own weapons.&nbsp;
By my advice the truth has been carefully concealed from you up to this
day.&nbsp; By my advice the trap into which you have walked was set
for you (you know why, now, as well as I do) in this place.&nbsp; There
was but one certain way of shaking the devilish self-control which has
hitherto made you a formidable man.&nbsp; That way has been tried, and
(look at me as you may) that way has succeeded.&nbsp; The last thing
that remains to be done,&rdquo; concluded Bintrey, producing two little
slips of manuscript from his despatch-box, &ldquo;is to set your niece
free.&nbsp; You have attempted murder, and you have committed forgery
and theft.&nbsp; We have the evidence ready against you in both cases.&nbsp;
If you are convicted as a felon, you know as well as I do what becomes
of your authority over your niece.&nbsp; Personally, I should have preferred
taking that way out of it.&nbsp; But considerations are pressed on me
which I am not able to resist, and this interview must end, as I have
told you already, in a compromise.&nbsp; Sign those lines, resigning
all authority over Miss Obenreizer, and pledging yourself never to be
seen in England or in Switzerland again; and I will sign an indemnity
which secures you against further proceedings on our part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer took the pen in silence, and signed his niece&rsquo;s
release.&nbsp; On receiving the indemnity in return, he rose, but made
no movement to leave the room.&nbsp; He stood looking at Ma&icirc;tre
Voigt with a strange smile gathering at his lips, and a strange light
flashing in his filmy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; asked Bintrey.</p>
<p>Obenreizer pointed to the brown door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call them back,&rdquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have something to say in their presence
before I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it in my presence,&rdquo; retorted Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
decline to call them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer turned to Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you remember
telling me that you once had an English client named Vendale?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the notary.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&icirc;tre Voigt, your clock-lock has betrayed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read the letters and certificates in your client&rsquo;s
box.&nbsp; I have taken copies of them.&nbsp; I have got the copies
here.&nbsp; Is there, or is there not, a reason for calling them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the notary looked to and fro, between Obenreizer and
Bintrey, in helpless astonishment.&nbsp; Recovering himself, he drew
his brother-lawyer aside, and hurriedly spoke a few words close at his
ear.&nbsp; The face of Bintrey&mdash;after first faithfully reflecting
the astonishment on the face of Ma&icirc;tre Voigt&mdash;suddenly altered
its expression.&nbsp; He sprang, with the activity of a young man, to
the door of the inner room, entered it, remained inside for a minute,
and returned followed by Marguerite and Vendale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Mr.
Obenreizer,&rdquo; said Bintrey, &ldquo;the last move in the game is
yours.&nbsp; Play it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I resign my position as that young lady&rsquo;s guardian,&rdquo;
said Obenreizer, &ldquo;I have a secret to reveal in which she is interested.&nbsp;
In making my disclosure, I am not claiming her attention for a narrative
which she, or any other person present, is expected to take on trust.&nbsp;
I am possessed of written proofs, copies of originals, the authenticity
of which Ma&icirc;tre Voigt himself can attest.&nbsp; Bear that in mind,
and permit me to refer you, at starting, to a date long past&mdash;the
month of February, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark the date, Mr. Vendale,&rdquo; said Bintrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first proof,&rdquo; said Obenreizer, taking a paper from
his pocket-book.&nbsp; &ldquo;Copy of a letter, written by an English
lady (married) to her sister, a widow.&nbsp; The name of the person
writing the letter I shall keep suppressed until I have done.&nbsp;
The name of the person to whom the letter is written I am willing to
reveal.&nbsp; It is addressed to &lsquo;Mrs. Jane Anne Miller, of Groombridge
Wells, England.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale started, and opened his lips to speak.&nbsp; Bintrey instantly
stopped him, as he had stopped Ma&icirc;tre Voigt.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said the pertinacious lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obenreizer went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is needless to trouble you with the first half of the letter,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can give the substance of it in two words.&nbsp;
The writer&rsquo;s position at the time is this.&nbsp; She has been
long living in Switzerland with her husband&mdash;obliged to live there
for the sake of her husband&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; They are about to
move to a new residence on the Lake of Neuch&acirc;tel in a week, and
they will be ready to receive Mrs. Miller as visitor in a fortnight
from that time.&nbsp; This said, the writer next enters into an important
domestic detail.&nbsp; She has been childless for years&mdash;she and
her husband have now no hope of children; they are lonely; they want
an interest in life; they have decided on adopting a child.&nbsp; Here
the important part of the letter begins; and here, therefore, I read
it to you word for word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folded back the first page of the letter and read as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;* * * Will you help us, my dear sister, to realise
our new project?&nbsp; As English people, we wish to adopt an English
child.&nbsp; This may be done, I believe, at the Foundling: my husband&rsquo;s
lawyers in London will tell you how.&nbsp; I leave the choice to you,
with only these conditions attached to it&mdash;that the child is to
be an infant under a year old, and is to be a boy.&nbsp; Will you pardon
the trouble I am giving you, for my sake; and will you bring our adopted
child to us, with your own children, when you come to Neuch&acirc;tel?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must add a word as to my husband&rsquo;s wishes in this
matter.&nbsp; He is resolved to spare the child whom we make our own
any future mortification and loss of self-respect which might be caused
by a discovery of his true origin.&nbsp; He will bear my husband&rsquo;s
name, and he will be brought up in the belief that he is really our
son.&nbsp; His inheritance of what we have to leave will be secured
to him&mdash;not only according to the laws of England in such cases,
but according to the laws of Switzerland also; for we have lived so
long in this country, that there is a doubt whether we may not be considered
as I domiciled, in Switzerland.&nbsp; The one precaution left to take
is to prevent any after-discovery at the Foundling.&nbsp; Now, our name
is a very uncommon one; and if we appear on the Register of the Institution
as the persons adopting the child, there is just a chance that something
might result from it.&nbsp; Your name, my dear, is the name of thousands
of other people; and if you will consent to appear on the Register,
there need be no fear of any discoveries in that quarter.&nbsp; We are
moving, by the doctor&rsquo;s orders, to a part of Switzerland in which
our circumstances are quite unknown; and you, as I understand, are about
to engage a new nurse for the journey when you come to see us.&nbsp;
Under these circumstances, the child may appear as my child, brought
back to me under my sister&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; The only servant we take
with us from our old home is my own maid, who can be safely trusted.&nbsp;
As for the lawyers in England and in Switzerland, it is their profession
to keep secrets&mdash;and we may feel quite easy in that direction.&nbsp;
So there you have our harmless little conspiracy!&nbsp; Write by return
of post, my love, and tell me you will join it.&rdquo; * * *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still conceal the name of the writer of that letter?&rdquo;
asked Vendale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep the name of the writer till the last,&rdquo; answered
Obenreizer, &ldquo;and I proceed to my second proof&mdash;a mere slip
of paper this time, as you see.&nbsp; Memorandum given to the Swiss
lawyer, who drew the documents referred to in the letter I have just
read, expressed as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Adopted from the Foundling
Hospital of England, 3d March, 1836, a male infant, called, in the Institution,
Walter Wilding.&nbsp; Person appearing on the register, as adopting
the child, Mrs. Jane Anne Miller, widow, acting in this matter for her
married sister, domiciled in Switzerland.&rsquo;&nbsp; Patience!&rdquo;
resumed Obenreizer, as Vendale, breaking loose from Bintrey, started
to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall not keep the name concealed much longer.&nbsp;
Two more little slips of paper, and I have done.&nbsp; Third proof!&nbsp;
Certificate of Doctor Ganz, still living in practice at Neuch&acirc;tel,
dated July, 1838.&nbsp; The doctor certifies (you shall read it for
yourselves directly), first, that he attended the adopted child in its
infant maladies; second, that, three months before the date of the certificate,
the gentleman adopting the child as his son died; third, that on the
date of the certificate, his widow and her maid, taking the adopted
child with them, left Neuch&acirc;tel on their return to England.&nbsp;
One more link now added to this, and my chain of evidence is complete.&nbsp;
The maid remained with her mistress till her mistress&rsquo;s death,
only a few years since.&nbsp; The maid can swear to the identity of
the adopted infant, from his childhood to his youth&mdash;from his youth
to his manhood, as he is now.&nbsp; There is her address in England&mdash;and
there, Mr. Vendale, is the fourth, and final proof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you address yourself to <i>me</i>?&rdquo; said Vendale,
as Obenreizer threw the written address on the table.</p>
<p>Obenreizer turned on him, in a sudden frenzy of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Because you are the man</i>!&nbsp; If my niece marries
you, she marries a bastard, brought up by public charity.&nbsp; If my
niece marries you, she marries an impostor, without name or lineage,
disguised in the character of a gentleman of rank and family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Admirably put, Mr.
Obenreizer!&nbsp; It only wants one word more to complete it.&nbsp;
She marries&mdash;thanks entirely to your exertions&mdash;a man who
inherits a handsome fortune, and a man whose origin will make him prouder
than ever of his peasant-wife.&nbsp; George Vendale, as brother-executors,
let us congratulate each other!&nbsp; Our dear dead friend&rsquo;s last
wish on earth is accomplished.&nbsp; We have found the lost Walter Wilding.&nbsp;
As Mr. Obenreizer said just now&mdash;you are the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words passed by Vendale unheeded.&nbsp; For the moment he was
conscious of but one sensation; he heard but one voice.&nbsp; Marguerite&rsquo;s
hand was clasping his.&nbsp; Marguerite&rsquo;s voice was whispering
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never loved you, George, as I love you now!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE CURTAIN FALLS</h3>
<p>May-day.&nbsp; There is merry-making in Cripple Corner, the chimneys
smoke, the patriarchal dining-hall is hung with garlands, and Mrs. Goldstraw,
the respected housekeeper, is very busy.&nbsp; For, on this bright morning
the young master of Cripple Corner is married to its young mistress,
far away: to wit, in the little town of Brieg, in Switzerland, lying
at the foot of the Simplon Pass where she saved his life.</p>
<p>The bells ring gaily in the little town of Brieg, and flags are stretched
across the street, and rifle shots are heard, and sounding music from
brass instruments.&nbsp; Streamer-decorated casks of wine have been
rolled out under a gay awning in the public way before the Inn, and
there will be free feasting and revelry.&nbsp; What with bells and banners,
draperies hanging from windows, explosion of gunpowder, and reverberation
of brass music, the little town of Brieg is all in a flutter, like the
hearts of its simple people.</p>
<p>It was a stormy night last night, and the mountains are covered with
snow.&nbsp; But the sun is bright to-day, the sweet air is fresh, the
tin spires of the little town of Brieg are burnished silver, and the
Alps are ranges of far-off white cloud in a deep blue sky.</p>
<p>The primitive people of the little town of Brieg have built a greenwood
arch across the street, under which the newly married pair shall pass
in triumph from the church.&nbsp; It is inscribed, on that side, &ldquo;HONOUR
AND LOVE TO MARGUERITE VENDALE!&rdquo; for the people are proud of her
to enthusiasm.&nbsp; This greeting of the bride under her new name is
affectionately meant as a surprise, and therefore the arrangement has
been made that she, unconscious why, shall be taken to the church by
a tortuous back way.&nbsp; A scheme not difficult to carry into execution
in the crooked little town of Brieg.</p>
<p>So, all things are in readiness, and they are to go and come on foot.&nbsp;
Assembled in the Inn&rsquo;s best chamber, festively adorned, are the
bride and bridegroom, the Neuch&acirc;tel notary, the London lawyer,
Madame Dor, and a certain large mysterious Englishman, popularly known
as Monsieur Zho&eacute;-Ladelle.&nbsp; And behold Madame Dor, arrayed
in a spotless pair of gloves of her own, with no hand in the air, but
both hands clasped round the neck of the bride; to embrace whom Madame
Dor has turned her broad back on the company, consistent to the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my beautiful,&rdquo; pleads Madame Dor, &ldquo;for
that I ever was his she-cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She-cat, Madame Dor?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged to sit watching my so charming mouse,&rdquo; are the
explanatory words of Madame Dor, delivered with a penitential sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you were our best friend!&nbsp; George, dearest, tell
Madame Dor.&nbsp; Was she not our best friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, darling.&nbsp; What should we have done without
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are both so generous,&rdquo; cries Madame Dor, accepting
consolation, and immediately relapsing.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I commenced
as a she-cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; But like the cat in the fairy-story, good Madame
Dor,&rdquo; says Vendale, saluting her cheek, &ldquo;you were a true
woman.&nbsp; And, being a true woman, the sympathy of your heart was
with true love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to deprive Madame Dor of her share in the
embraces that are going on,&rdquo; Mr. Bintrey puts in, watch in hand,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t presume to offer any objection to your having
got yourselves mixed together, in the corner there, like the three Graces.&nbsp;
I merely remark that I think it&rsquo;s time we were moving.&nbsp; What
are <i>your</i> sentiments on that subject, Mr. Ladle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear, sir,&rdquo; replies Joey, with a gracious grin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m clearer altogether, sir, for having lived so many weeks
upon the surface.&nbsp; I never was half so long upon the surface afore,
and it&rsquo;s done me a power of good.&nbsp; At Cripple Corner, I was
too much below it.&nbsp; Atop of the Simpleton, I was a deal too high
above it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found the medium here, sir.&nbsp; And if
ever I take it in convivial, in all the rest of my days, I mean to do
it this day, to the toast of &lsquo;Bless &lsquo;em both.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too!&rdquo; says Bintrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, Monsieur
Voigt, let you and me be two men of Marseilles, and allons, marchons,
arm-in-arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go down to the door, where others are waiting for them, and
they go quietly to the church, and the happy marriage takes place.&nbsp;
While the ceremony is yet in progress, the notary is called out.&nbsp;
When it is finished, he has returned, is standing behind Vendale, and
touches him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the side door, one moment, Monsieur Vendale.&nbsp; Alone.&nbsp;
Leave Madame to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the side door of the church, are the same two men from the Hospice.&nbsp;
They are snow-stained and travel-worn.&nbsp; They wish him joy, and
then each lays his broad hand upon Vendale&rsquo;s breast, and one says
in a low voice, while the other steadfastly regards him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here, Monsieur.&nbsp; Your litter.&nbsp; The very same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My litter is here?&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; For the sake of Madame.&nbsp; Your companion of
that day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looks at his comrade, and his comrade takes him up.&nbsp;
Each keeps his hand laid earnestly on Vendale&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been living at the first Refuge, monsieur, for some
days.&nbsp; The weather was now good, now bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He arrived at our Hospice the day before yesterday, and, having
refreshed himself with sleep on the floor before the fire, wrapped in
his cloak, was resolute to go on, before dark, to the next Hospice.&nbsp;
He had a great fear of that part of the way, and thought it would be
worse to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went on alone.&nbsp; He had passed the gallery when an
avalanche&mdash;like that which fell behind you near the Bridge of the
Ganther&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dug him out, suffocated and broken all to pieces!&nbsp;
But, monsieur, as to Madame.&nbsp; We have brought him here on the litter,
to be buried.&nbsp; We must ascend the street outside.&nbsp; Madame
must not see.&nbsp; It would be an accursed thing to bring the litter
through the arch across the street, until Madame has passed through.&nbsp;
As you descend, we who accompany the litter will set it down on the
stones of the street the second to the right, and will stand before
it.&nbsp; But do not let Madame turn her head towards the street the
second to the right.&nbsp; There is no time to lose.&nbsp; Madame will
be alarmed by your absence.&nbsp; Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vendale returns to his bride, and draws her hand through his unmainied
arm.&nbsp; A pretty procession awaits them at the main door of the church.&nbsp;
They take their station in it, and descend the street amidst the ringing
of the bells, the firing of the guns, the waving of the flags, the playing
of the music, the shouts, the smiles, and tears, of the excited town.&nbsp;
Heads are uncovered as she passes, hands are kissed to her, all the
people bless her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s benediction on the dear
girl!&nbsp; See where she goes in her youth and beauty; she who so nobly
saved his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the corner of the street the second to the right, he speaks
to her, and calls her attention to the windows on the opposite side.&nbsp;
The corner well passed, he says: &ldquo;Do not look round, my darling,
for a reason that I have,&rdquo; and turns his head.&nbsp; Then, looking
back along the street, he sees the litter and its bearers passing up
alone under the arch, as he and she and their marriage train go down
towards the shining valley.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
